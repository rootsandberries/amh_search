TI  - Later Abortions and Mental Health: Psychological Experiences of Women Having Later Abortions-A Critical Review of Research
T2  - WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES
AB  - Background: Some abortion policies in the U.S. are based on the notion that abortion harms women's mental health. The American Psychological Association (APA) Task Force on Abortion and Mental Health concluded that first-trimester abortions do not harm women's mental health. However, the APA task force does not make conclusions regarding later abortions (second trimester or beyond) and mental health. This paper critically evaluates studies on later abortion and mental health in order to inform both policy and practice.
   Method: Using guidelines outlined by Steinberg and Russo (2009), post 1989 quantitative studies on later abortion and mental health were evaluated on the following qualities: 1) composition of comparison groups, 2) how prior mental health was assessed, and 3) whether common risk factors were controlled for in analyses if a significant relationship between abortion and mental health was found. Studies were evaluated with respect to the claim that later abortions harm women's mental health.
   Results: Eleven quantitative studies that compared the mental health of women having later abortions (for reasons of fetal anomaly) with other groups were evaluated. Findings differed depending on the comparison group. No studies considered the role of prepregnancy mental health, and one study considered whether factors common among women having later abortions and mental health problems drove the association between later abortion and mental health.
   Conclusion: Policies based on the notion that later abortions (because of fetal anomaly) harm women's mental health are unwarranted. Because research suggests that most women who have later abortions do so for reasons other than fetal anomaly, future investigations should examine women's psychological experiences around later abortions.

TI  - The "Psychiatric Masquerade": The Mental Health Exception in New Zealand Abortion Law
T2  - FEMINIST LEGAL STUDIES
AB  - Although nearly 99% of abortions in New Zealand are permitted in order to prevent danger or injury to a woman's mental health (the 'mental health exception'), the reasons why mental health considerations should effectively control access to abortion are not altogether clear. This article analyses abortion case law, statutes and debates from New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States to attempt to explain the legal connection between mental health considerations and access to abortion. The article argues that the mental health exception evolved in response to a change in the predominant construction of women seeking abortion from 'selfish' to 'desperate', coinciding with increasing societal subscription to an expanded view of psychological harm. By conceptually accommodating both constructions of women seeking abortion, the article argues that the mental health exception usefully enabled society generally to proscribe the practice of abortion on the basis that it was unnatural and irrational, while nevertheless permitting it in cases considered to be deserving.

TI  - Abortion and Mental Health Evaluating the Evidence
T2  - AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
AB  - The authors evaluated empirical research addressing the relationship between induced abortion and women's mental health. Two issues were addressed: (a) the relative risks associated with abortion compared with the risks associated with its alternatives and (b) sources of variability in women's responses following abortion. This article reflects and updates the report of the American Psychological Association Task Force on Mental Health and Abortion (2008). Major methodological problems pervaded most of the research reviewed. The most rigorous studies indicated that within the United States, the relative risk of mental health problems among adult women who have a single, legal, first-trimester abortion of an unwanted pregnancy is no greater than the risk among women who deliver an unwanted pregnancy. Evidence did not support the claim that observed associations between abortion and mental health problems are caused by abortion per se as opposed to other preexisting and co-occurring risk factors. Most adult women who terminate a pregnancy do not experience mental health problems. Some women do, however. It is important that women's varied experiences of abortion be recognized, validated, and understood.

TI  - Reactions to abortion and subsequent mental health
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background
   There has been continued interest in the extent to which women have positive and negative reactions to abortion.
   Aims
   To document emotional reactions to abortion, and to examine the links between reactions to abortion and subsequent mental health outcomes.
   Method
   Data were gathered on the pregnancy and mental health history of a birth cohort of over 500 women studied to the age of 30.
   Results
   Abortion was associated with high rates of both positive and negative emotional reactions; however, nearly 90% of respondents believed that the abortion was the right decision. Analyses showed that the number of negative responses to the abortion was associated with increased levels of subsequent mental health disorders (P < 0.05). Further analyses suggested that, after adjustment for confounding, those having an abortion and reporting negative reactions had rates of mental health disorders that were approximately 1.4-1.8 times higher than those not having an abortion.
   Conclusions
   Abortion was associated with both positive and negative emotional reactions. The extent of negative emotional reactions appeared to modify the links between abortion and subsequent mental health problems.

TI  - Examining differences in attitudes toward legal abortion in cases of endangered mental health for pregnant women: Insights from a US national survey
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB  - We explored demographic differences in attitudes toward abortion in the case of mental health endangerment. A web-based survey was administered in English and Spanish to a sample of 1,583 participants. Using ordinal logistic regression with partial proportional odds, we regressed political affiliation, race/ethnicity, education, and religious attendance on people's attitudes toward abortion legality when a woman's mental health is endangered. Democrats and people affiliated outside of the Republican party, greater educational attainment, and attending religious services less than once a week were associated with greater endorsement of legal abortion in the case of mental health endangerment. Since abortion in the context of health endangerment is commonly discussed in abortion legislation, it is important for researchers to examine people's attitudes when considering this specific abortion context.

TI  - A Cohort Study of Mental Health Services Utilization Following a First Pregnancy Abortion or Birth
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Objective: To determine whether exposure to a first pregnancy outcome of induced abortion, compared to a live birth, is associated with an increased risk and likelihood of mental health morbidity. Materials and methods: Participants were continuously eligible Medicaid beneficiaries age 16 in 1999, and assigned to either of two cohorts based upon the first pregnancy outcome, abortion (n = 1331) or birth (n = 3517), and followed through to 2015. Outcomes were mental health outpatient visits, inpatient hospital admissions, and hospital days of stay. Exposure periods before and after the first pregnancy outcome, a total of 17 years, were determined for each cohort. Findings: Women with first pregnancy abortions, compared to women with births, had higher risk and likelihood of experiencing all three mental health outcome events in the transition from pre-to post-pregnancy outcome periods: outpatient visits (RR 2.10, CL 2.08- 2.12 and OR 3.36, CL 3.29-3.42); hospital inpatient admissions (RR 2.75, CL 2.38-3.18 and OR 5.67, CL 4.39-7.32); hospital inpatient days of stay (RR 7.38, CL 6.83-7.97 and OR 19.64, CL 17.70-21.78). On average, abortion cohort women experienced shorter exposure time before (6.43 versus 7.80 years), and longer exposure time after (10.57 versus 9.20 years) the first pregnancy outcome than birth cohort women. Utilization rates before the first pregnancy outcome, for all three utilization events, were higher for the birth cohort than for the abortion cohort. Conclusion: A first pregnancy abortion, compared to a birth, is associated with significantly higher subsequent mental health services utilization following the first pregnancy outcome. The risk attributable to abortion is notably higher for inpatient than outpatient mental health services. Higher mental health utilization before the first pregnancy outcome for birth cohort women challenges the explanation that pre-existing mental health history explains mental health problems following abortion, rather than the abortion itself.

TI  - Legal abortion for mental health indications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
AB  - Where legal systems allow therapeutic abortion to preserve women's mental health, practitioners often lack access to mental health professionals for making critical diagnoses or prognoses that pregnancy or childcare endangers patients' mental health. Practitioners themselves must then make clinical assessments of the impact on their patients of continued pregnancy or childcare. The law requires only that practitioners make assessments in good faith, and by credible criteria. Mental disorder includes psychological distress or mental suffering due to unwanted pregnancy and responsibility for childcare, or, for instance, anticipated serious fetal impairment. Account should be taken of factors that make patients vulnerable to distress, such as personal or family mental health history, factors that may precipitate mental distress, such as loss of personal relationships, and factors that may maintain distress, such as poor education and marginal social status. Some characteristics of patients may operate as both precipitating and maintaining factors, such as poverty and lack of social support. (c) 2006 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

TI  - Unintended Pregnancy, Induced Abortion, and Mental Health
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHIATRY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review The early medical literature on mental health outcomes following abortion is fraught with methodological flaws that can improperly influence clinical practice. Our goal is to review the current medical literature on depression and other mental health outcomes for women obtaining abortions.
   Recent Findings The Turnaway Study prospectively enrolled 956 women seeking abortion in the USA and followed their mental health outcomes for 5 years. The control group was comprised of women denied abortions based on gestational age limits, thereby circumventing the major methodological flaw that had plagued earlier studies on the topic.
   Summary Rates of depression are not significantly different between women obtaining abortion and those denied abortion. Rates of anxiety are initially higher in women denied abortion care. Counseling on decision-making for women with unintended pregnancies should reflect these findings.

TI  - Psychosocial factors and pre-abortion psychological health: The significance of stigma
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale: Most research in mental health and abortion has examined factors associated with post abortion psychological health. However, research that follows women from before to after their abortion consistently finds that depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms are highest just before an abortion compared to any time afterwards.
   Objective: This finding suggests that studies investigating psychosocial factors related to pre-abortion mental health are warranted.
   Methods: The current study uses data from 353 women seeking abortions at three community reproductive health clinics to examine predictors of pre-abortion psychological health. Drawing from three perspectives in the abortion and mental health literature, common risks, stress and coping, and sociocultural context, we conducted multivariable analyses to examine the contribution of important factors on depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms just before an abortion, including sociodemographics, abortion characteristics, childhood adversities, recent adversities with an intimate partner, relationship context, future pregnancy desires, and perceived abortion stigma.
   Results: Childhood and partner adversities, including reproductive coercion, were associated with negative mental health symptoms, as was perceived abortion stigma. Before perceived abortion stigma was entered into the model, 18.6%, 20.7%, and 16.8% of the variance in depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms respectively, was explained. Perceived abortion stigma explained an additional 13.2%, 9.7%, and 10.7% of the variance in depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms pre-abortion.
   Conclusion: This study, one of the first to focus on pre-abortion mental health as an outcome, suggests that addressing stigma among women seeking abortions may significantly lower their psychological distress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does abortion reduce the mental health risks of unwanted or unintended pregnancy? A re-appraisal of the evidence
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Objective:
   There have been debates about the linkages between abortion and mental health. Few reviews have considered the extent to which abortion has therapeutic benefits that mitigate the mental health risks of abortion. The aim of this review was to conduct a re-appraisal of the evidence to examine the research hypothesis that abortion reduces rates of mental health problems in women having unwanted or unintended pregnancy.
   Methods:
   Analysis of recent reviews (Coleman, 2011; National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2011) identified eight publications reporting 14 adjusted odds ratios (AORs) spanning five outcome domains: anxiety; depression; alcohol misuse; illicit drug use/misuse; and suicidal behaviour. For each outcome, pooled AORs were estimated using a random-effects model.
   Results:
   There was consistent evidence to show that abortion was not associated with a reduction in rates of mental health problems (p>0.75). Abortion was associated with small to moderate increases in risks of anxiety (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 0.97-1.70; p<0.08), alcohol misuse (AOR 2.34, 95% CI 1.05-5.21; p<0.05), illicit drug use/misuse (AOR 3.91, 95% CI 1.13-13.55; p<0.05), and suicidal behaviour (AOR 1.69, 95% CI 1.12-2.54; p<0.01).
   Conclusions:
   There is no available evidence to suggest that abortion has therapeutic effects in reducing the mental health risks of unwanted or unintended pregnancy. There is suggestive evidence that abortion may be associated with small to moderate increases in risks of some mental health problems.

TI  - Abortion and long-term mental health outcomes: a systematic review of the evidence
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Claims that women who have elective abortions will experience psychological distress have fueled much of the recent debate on abortion. It has been argued that the emotional sequelae of abortion may not occur until months or years after the event. Despite unclear evidence on such a phenomenon, adverse mental health outcomes of abortion have been used as a rationale for policy-making. We systematically searched for articles focused on the potential association between abortion and long-term mental health outcomes published between January 1, 1989 and August 1, 2008 and reviewed 21 studies that met the inclusion criteria. We rated the study quality based on methodological factors necessary to appropriately explore the research question. Studies were rated as Excellent (no studies), Very Good (4 studies), Fair (8 studies), Poor (8 studies), or Very Poor (1 study). A clear trend emerges from this systematic review: the highest quality studies had findings that were mostly neutral, suggesting few, if any, differences between women who had abortions and their respective comparison groups in terms of mental health sequelae. Conversely, studies with the most flawed methodology found negative mental health sequelae of abortion. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Protective and risk factors for women's mental health after a spontaneous abortion
T2  - REVISTA LATINO-AMERICANA DE ENFERMAGEM
AB  - Objective: to examine personal and contextual protective and risk factors associated with women's mental health after a spontaneous abortion. Method: a cross-sectional study was carried out where 231 women who had experienced spontaneous abortions in the past 4 years answered a self-reporting online questionnaire to assess their mental health (symptoms of depression, anxiety, perinatal grief) and to collect personal as well as contextual characteristics. Results: women who had experienced spontaneous abortions within the past 6 months had higher scores for depressive symptoms than those who had experienced spontaneous abortions between 7 and 12 months ago, while anxiety level and perinatal grief did not vary according to the time since the loss. Moreover, low socioeconomic status, immigrant status, and childlessness were associated with worse mental health after a spontaneous abortion. In contrast, the quality of the conjugal relationship and the level of satisfaction with health care were positively associated with women's mental health. Conclusion: women in vulnerable situations, such as immigrants, women with a low socioeconomic status, or childless women are particularly vulnerable to mental health problems after a spontaneous abortion. However, beyond those personal and contextual factors, the quality of the conjugal relationship and the level of satisfaction with health care could be important protective factors.

TI  - Abortion and mental health disorders: evidence from a 30-year longitudinal study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background
   Research on the links between abortion and mental health has been limited by design problems and relatively weak evidence.
   Aims
   To examine the links between pregnancy outcomes and mental health outcomes.
   Method
   Data were gathered on the pregnancy and mental health history of a birth cohort of over 500 women studied to the age of 30.
   Results
   After adjustment for confounding, abortion was associated with a small increase in the risk of mental disorders; women who had had abortions had rates of mental disorder that were about 30% higher. There were no consistent associations between other pregnancy outcomes and mental health. Estimates of attributable risk indicated that exposure to abortion accounted for 1.5% to 5.5% of the overall rate of mental disorders.
   Conclusions
   The evidence is consistent with the view that abortion may be associated with a small increase in risk of mental disorders. Other pregnancy outcomes were not related to increased risk of mental health problems.

TI  - Abortion and mental health: quantitative synthesis and analysis of research published 1995-2009
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background
   Given the methodological limitations of recently published qualitative reviews of abortion and mental health, a quantitative synthesis was deemed necessary to represent more accurately the published literature and to provide clarity to clinicians.
   Aims
   To measure the association between abortion and indicators of adverse mental health, with subgroup effects calculated based on comparison groups (no abortion, unintended pregnancy delivered, pregnancy delivered) and particular outcomes. A secondary objective was to calculate population-attributable risk (PAR) statistics for each outcome.
   Method
   After the application of methodologically based selection criteria and extraction rules to minimise bias, the sample comprised 22 studies, 36 measures of effect and 877 181 participants (163 831 experienced an abortion). Random effects pooled odds ratios were computed using adjusted odds ratios from the original studies and PAR statistics were derived from the pooled odds ratios.
   Results
   Women who had undergone an abortion experienced an 81% increased risk of mental health problems, and nearly 10% of the incidence of mental health problems was shown to be attributable to abortion. The strongest subgroup estimates of increased risk occurred when abortion was compared with term pregnancy and when the outcomes pertained to substance use and suicidal behaviour.
   Conclusions
   This review offers the largest quantitative estimate of mental health risks associated with abortion available in the world literature. Calling into question the conclusions from traditional reviews, the results revealed a moderate to highly increased risk of mental health problems after abortion. Consistent with the tenets of evidence-based medicine, this information should inform the delivery of abortion services.

TI  - Abortion and the mental health of women
T2  - ACTA BIOETHICA
AB  - The existence or the lack of alterations of mental health of women as consequence of abortion currently arises a lively debate, since, while there are convinced professionals defending its existence, others are completely opposed to it. In order to examine this issue we have evaluated some of most recent reviews considering they have contrasted methodological value, as well as some of the latest published articles. We can conclude that there is no post abortion syndrome as such, but there are secondary psychological disorders after abortion. Finally, we reflect about in which extent the feeling of guilt that woman may experiment for having aborted may influence the presentation or not of psychological disorders after the abortion act.

TI  - Abortion in young women and subsequent mental health
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: The extent to which abortion has harmful consequences for mental health remains controversial. We aimed to examine the linkages between having an abortion and mental health outcomes over the interval from age 15-25 years. Methods: Data were gathered as part of the Christchurch Health and Development Study, a 25-year longitudinal study of a birth cohort of New Zealand children. Information was obtained on: a) the history of pregnancy/abortion for female participants over the interval from 15-25 years; b) measures of DSM-IV mental disorders and suicidal behaviour over the intervals 15-18, 18-21 and 21-25 years; and c) childhood, family and related confounding factors. Results: Forty-one percent of women had become pregnant on at least one occasion prior to age 25, with 14.6% having an abortion. Those having an abortion had elevated rates of subsequent mental health problems including depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviours and substance use disorders. This association persisted after adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusions: The findings suggest that abortion in young women may be associated with increased risks of mental health problems.

This article explores the origins of these barriers, their nature, and their impact on mental health. The most controversial relationship is between induced abortion and mental health. Barriers, misinformation, and coercion affecting contraceptive, abortion, and pregnancy care are an ongoing danger to women's mental health and the well-being of their families.

In this study, the psychiatric history of women who have had an abortion is investigated. 325 Women who recently had an abortion were compared with 1902 women from the population-based Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS-2). Lifetime prevalence estimates of various mental disorders were measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Compared to the reference sample, women in the abortion sample were three times more likely to report a history of any mental disorder (OR = 3.06, 95% CI = 2.36-3.98). The highest odds were found for conduct disorder (OR = 6.97,95% CI = 4.41-11.01) and drug dependence (OR = 4.96, 95% CI = 2.55-9.66). Similar results were found for lifetime-minus-last-year prevalence estimates and for women who had first-time abortions only. The results support the notion that psychiatric history may explain associations that have been found between abortion and mental health. Psychiatric history should therefore be taken into account when investigating the mental health consequences of abortion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Complex situations: Economic insecurity, mental health, and substance use among pregnant women who consider - but do not have - abortions
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - We examine characteristics and experiences of women who considered, but did not have, an abortion for this pregnancy. Participants were recruited at prenatal care clinics in Louisiana and Maryland for a mixed-methods study (N = 589). On self-administered surveys and structured interviews, participants were asked if they had considered abortion for this pregnancy and, if so, reasons they did not obtain one. A subset (n = 83), including participants who considered abortion for this pregnancy, completed in-depth phone interviews. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined characteristics associated with having considered abortion and experiencing a policy-related barrier to having an abortion; analyses focused on economic insecurity and of mental health/substance use as main predictors of interest. Louisiana interviews (n = 43) were analyzed using modified grounded theory to understand concrete experiences of policy-related factors. In regression analyses, women who reported greater economic insecurity (aOR 1.21 [95% CI 1.17, 1.26]) and more mental health diagnoses/substance use (aOR 1.29 [1.16, 1.45] had higher odds of having considered abortion. Those who reported greater economic insecurity (aOR 1.50 [1.09, 2.08]) and more mental health diagnoses/substance use (aOR 1.45 [95% CI 1.03, 2.05] had higher odds of reporting policy-related barriers. Interviewees who considered abortion and were subject to multiple restrictions on abortion identified material and instrumental impacts of policies that, collectively, contributed to them not having an abortion. Many described simultaneously navigating economic insecurity, mental health disorders, substance use, and interpersonal opposition to abortion from family and the man involved in the pregnancy. Current restrictive abortion policies appear to have more of an impact on women who report greater economic insecurity and more mental health diagnoses/substance use. These policies work in concert with each other, with people's individual complex situations-including economic insecurity, mental health, and substance use-and with anti-abortion attitudes of other people to make abortion care impossible for some pregnant women to access.

TI  - Update on Reproductive Rights and Women's Mental Health
T2  - MEDICAL CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB  - Reproductive rights are essential to the recognition/treatment of women as full-fledged human beings/citizens. Barriers to reproductive rights pose a grave danger to women's well-being. This article explores the origins of these barriers, their nature, and their impact on mental health. The most controversial relationship is between induced abortion and mental health. Barriers, misinformation, and coercion affecting contraceptive, abortion, and pregnancy care are an ongoing danger to women's mental health and the well-being of their families. Mental health professionals are best qualified, and have an obligation, to know the facts, apply them, and provide accurate information to protect women's health.

TI  - To meta-analyse or not to meta-analyse: abortion, birth and mental health
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Two recent meta-analyses claim that abortion leads to a deterioration in mental health. Previous reviews concluded that the mental health outcomes following an unwanted pregnancy are much the same whether the woman gives birth or terminates the pregnancy, although there is an increased mental health risk with an unwanted pregnancy. Meta-analysis is particularly susceptible to bias in this area. The physical health outcomes for women with an unwanted pregnancy have improved greatly by making abortion legal. To further improve the mental health outcomes associated with an unwanted pregnancy we should focus practice and research on the individual needs of women with an unwanted pregnancy, rather than how the pregnancy is resolved.

TI  - Abortion, unwanted childbearing, and mental health
T2  - SALUD MENTAL
AB  - There is a substantial literature of correlational findings from studies in developed countries where abortion is legal that are riddled with methodological problems and selective biases that exaggerate post-pregnancy mental health risks of abortion while minimizing risks for unwanted childbearing. Health professionals need to be able to critically evaluate this literature and use caution when generalizing findings across contexts differing in legal grounds for abortion. The impact of diversity in women's characteristics, circumstances, and reasons for avoiding childbirth has not been adequately incorporated in theory or research seeking to explain the variations that are found in women's post-abortion mental health. Critical reviews have established that predictors of problems after abortion or childbirth are similar. Further, when a woman has an unwanted pregnancy, i.e., a pregnancy that she does not wish to end in a term birth, the likelihood that she will have post-pregnancy mental health problems is similar regardless of pregnancy outcome (abortion vs. delivery). Selective sampling bias that advantages the delivery group, common risk factors, and confounding of abortion with unintended pregnancy explain the correlation of legal abortion with negative outcomes observed in the literature from developed countries. Meanwhile, documented negative effects of unwanted pregnancy and childbearing are multiple, severe, and long-lasting for mother and child. Changing societal conditions, particularly in developing countries, provide an opportunity for correcting biases and limitations of current research. High quality studies aimed at understanding the varied relationships of unintended pregnancy to mental health outcomes -both positive and negative in the context of the diverse circumstances of women's lives are sorely needed. Such studies can inform the development of programs to reduce unwanted childbearing and promote pre- and post-pregnancy mental health for all women, regardless of how they choose to end their pregnancy.

TI  - The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on abortion access and pre-abortion mental health in Shanghai
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
AB  - Objective To understand the barriers to abortion in Shanghai during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to compare pre-abortion mental health status before and during the crisis. Methods In this case-control study, two groups of women seeking abortion (age >= 18 years, pregnancy duration <98 days) were recruited from March to September, 2021 (n = 1070) and from February to April 2022 (n = 625). The evaluation included COVID-19-related abortion stress questions, the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Family Environment Scale Chinese version. The researchers conducted interviews and collected questionnaires. Results The median pregnancy duration at abortion among women during the pandemic was 65 days, compared with 51 days in the pre-pandemic group (P < 0.001). Anxiety and depression symptoms increased during the crisis (P < 0.001). Sleep disturbances were more common. Higher PSQI scores were related to increased anxiety and depression symptoms. A more negative family climate was described during the pandemic. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, abortion access was delayed and pre-abortion mental disorders increased. More attention should be paid to the mental health of women seeking abortions, and innovations should be promoted to ensure abortion services without delay.

TI  - Misinformation on abortion
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTRACEPTION AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE
AB  - Objective To find the latest and most accurate information on aspects of induced abortion.
   Methods A literature survey was carried out in which five aspects of abortion were scrutinised: risk to life, risk of breast cancer, risk to mental health, risk to future fertility, and fetal pain.
   Findings Abortion is clearly safer than childbirth. There is no evidence of an association between abortion and breast cancer. Women who have abortions are not at increased risk of mental health problems over and above women who deliver an unwanted pregnancy. There is no negative effect of abortion on a woman's subsequent fertility. It is not possible for a fetus to perceive pain before 24 weeks'' gestation. Misinformation on abortion is widespread. Literature and websites are cited to demonstrate how data have been manipulated and misquoted or just ignored. Citation of non-peer reviewed articles is also common. Mandates insisting on provision of inaccurate information in some US State laws are presented. Attention is drawn to how women can be misled by Crisis Pregnancy Centres.
   Conclusion There is extensive promulgation of misinformation on abortion by those who oppose abortion. Much of this misinformation is based on distorted interpretation of the scientific literature.

TI  - Childhood adversities and subsequent risk of one or multiple abortions
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Although many studies have found an association between childhood adversities and mental health disorders, few have examined whether childhood adversities are linked to having abortions. This research investigates the association between a range of childhood adversities and risk of abortion in part to identify which adversities should be considered when examining the association between abortion and subsequent mental health. Using the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R), we tested the association between 10 childhood adversities and risk of 0,1, or multiple abortions among 1511 women ages 18-41. We employed multinomial logistic regression to examine the independent association between each childhood adversity and number of subsequent abortions, controlling for sociodemographic factors, total number of pregnancies, and each adversity. Women who had experienced two or more personal safety threats, one parental mental illness, or two or more parental mental illnesses while growing up were more likely subsequently to have multiple versus no abortions [Relative Risk Ratio (RRR) = 9.87, 95% CI: 2.45-39.72; OR = 2.81,95% CI: 1.27-6.21; RRR = 5.28, 95% Cl: 1.60-17.38, respectively], and multiple versus one abortion [RRR = 13.33, 95% Cl: 2.48-71.68; RRR = 2.17, 95% Cl: 1.03-4.56; RRR = 3.67, 95% Cl: 1.15-11.76, respectively]. Women who had experienced childhood physical abuse were more likely to have one compared to no abortions [RRR = 2.00; 1.19-3.34]. These results suggest that some childhood adversities may partially explain the association between abortion and mental health. Accordingly, they should be considered in future research examining the link between abortion and mental health. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improving stigma and psychosocial outcomes among post-abortion Kenyan women attending private clinics: A randomized controlled trial of a person-centered mobile phone-based intervention
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Objectives
   The objective of this study was to evaluate a person-centered abortion care mobile-based intervention on perceived social stigma, social support, mental health and post-abortion care experiences among Kenyan women who received abortion services at private clinics.
   Methods
   This randomized controlled study enrolled women who obtained an abortion from private clinics in Nairobi county, Kenya and randomized them into one of three study arms: 1) standard of care (follow-up by service provider call center); 2) post-abortion phone follow-up by a peer counselor (a woman who has had an abortion herself and is trained in person-centered abortion care); or 3) post-abortion phone follow-up by a nurse (a nurse who is trained in person-centered abortion care). All participants were followed-up at two- and four-weeks post-abortion to evaluate intervention effects on mental health, social support, and abortion-related stigma scores. A Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test was used to assess the effect of each intervention compared to the control group. In total, 371 women participated at baseline and were each randomized to the study arms.
   Results
   Using Kruskal-Wallis tests, the nurse arm improved mental health scores from baseline to week two; however this was only marginally significant (p = 0.059). The nurse arm also lowered stigma scores from baseline to week four, and this was marginally significant (p = 0.099). No other differences were found between the study arms. This person-centered mobile phone-based intervention may improve mental health and decrease perceived stigma among Kenyan women who received abortion services in private clinics.
   Conclusions
   Nurses trained in person-centered abortion care, in particular, may improve women's experiences post-abortion and potentially reduce feelings of shame and stigma and improve mental health in this context.

T2  - BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH CLINICAL OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY
AB  - The decision to seek an abortion is never easy. Women have different reasons for choosing an abortion and their social, economic and religious background may influence how they cope. Furthermore, once pregnant, the alternatives of childbirth and adoption or keeping the baby may not be psychologically neutral. Research studies in this area have been hampered by methodological problems, but most of the better-quality studies have shown no increased risk of mental health problems in women having an abortion. A consistent finding has been that of preexisting mental illness and subsequent mental health problems after either abortion or childbirth. Furthermore, studies have shown that only a minority of women experience any lasting sadness or regret. Risk factors for this include ambivalence about the decision, level of social support and whether or not the pregnancy was originally intended. More robust, definitive research studies are required on mental health after abortion and alternative outcomes such as childbirth. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Addressing the Silence in the Noise: How Abortion Support Talklines Meet Some Women's Needs for Non-Political Discussion of Their Experiences
T2  - WOMEN & HEALTH
AB  - Abortion is a frequent topic in political discourse ,but few opportunities are available for women to discuss their complex emotions and experiences concerning abortion. Popular belief holds that many women need "counseling" about their decision to have an abortion, but little systematic after-abortion emotional care is available. The authors of this study conducted semi-structured interviews (N=7) and focus groups (N=2; 13 participants) with staff members and volunteer counselors at four abortion support talklines between February 2009 and March 2010 for their insights into the post-abortion needs of callers. The authors found evidence that some women needed a space devoid of politics for processing their experience and emotions overtime. Talklines begin to meet these needs, especially the episodic processing needs of women experiencing emotional difficulty at any time after an abortion. However, some mental health needs are still unmet, including those among women experiencing emotional difficulty due to preexisting conditions co-occurring with, but not caused by, the abortion. The authors of this study call for integrating after-abortion emotional support more fully into the work of aborton provision and women's mental health advocates. The authors warn against using these findings to support legal mandates for post-abortion support, highlighting the negative consequences of such mandates in the pre-abortion arena.

AB  - Using the US National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), Coleman, Coyle, Shuping, and Rue (2009) published an analysis indicating that compared to women who had never had an abortion, women who had reported an abortion were at an increased risk of several anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders. Here, we show that those results are not replicable. That is, using the same data, sample, and codes as indicated by those authors, it is not possible to replicate the simple bivariate statistics testing the relationship of ever having had an abortion to each mental health disorder when no factors were controlled for in analyses (Table 2 in Coleman et al., 2009). Furthermore, among women with prior pregnancies in the NCS, we investigated whether having zero, one, or multiple abortions (abortion history) was associated with having a mood, anxiety, or substance use disorder at the time of the interview. In doing this, we tested two competing frameworks: the abortion-as-trauma versus the common-risk-factors approach. Our results support the latter framework. In the bivariate context when no other factors were included in models, abortion history was not related to having a mood disorder, but it was related to having an anxiety or substance use disorder. When prior mental health and violence experience were controlled in our models, no significant relation was found between abortion history and anxiety disorders. When these same risk factors and other background factors were controlled, women who had multiple abortions remained at an increased risk of having a substance use disorder compared to women who had no abortions, likely because we were unable to control for other risk factors associated with having an abortion and substance use. Policy, practice, and research should focus on assisting women at greatest risk of having unintended pregnancies and having poor mental health those with violence in their lives and prior mental health problems.

TI  - Fatal flaws in a recent meta-analysis on abortion and mental health
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Similar to other reviews within the last 4 years, a thorough review by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, published in December 2011, found that compared to delivery of an unintended pregnancy, abortion does not increase women's risk of mental health problems. In contrast, a meta-analysis published in September 2011 concluded that abortion increases women's risk of mental health problems by 81% and that 10% of mental health problems are attributable to abortions. Like others, we strongly question the quality of this meta-analysis and its conclusions. Here we detail seven errors of this meta-analysis and three significant shortcomings of the included studies because policy, practice and the public have been misinformed. These errors and shortcomings render the meta-analysis' conclusions invalid. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The end of Roe v. Wade: implications for Women's mental health and care
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - The Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson in June 2022 reversed precedent which had previously protected abortion prior to fetal viability as a universal right within the United States. This decision almost immediately led to abortion restrictions across 25 states. The resulting lack of access to abortion care for millions of pregnant people will have profound physical and mental health consequences, the full effects of which will not be realized for years to come. Approximately 1 in 5 women access abortions in the U.S. each year. These women are diverse and represent all American groups. The Supreme court decision, however, will affect populations that have and continue to be marginalized the most. Forcing pregnant individuals to carry unwanted pregnancies worsens health outcomes and mortality risk for both the perinatal individual and the offspring. The US has one of the highest maternal mortality rates and this rate is projected to increase with abortion bans. Abortion policies also interfere with appropriate medical care of pregnant people leading to less safe pregnancies for all. Beyond the physical morbidity, the psychological sequelae of carrying a forced pregnancy to term will lead to an even greater burden of maternal mental illness, exacerbating the already existing maternal mental health crisis. This perspective piece reviews the current evidence of abortion denial on women's mental health and care. Based on the current evidence, we discuss the clinical, educational, societal, research, and policy implications of the Dobbs v. Jackson Supreme Court decision.

TI  - Decision making for termination of pregnancies and the pre-abortion period in the context of women's mental health
T2  - ORVOSI HETILAP
AB  - Based on statistical figures of the past 30 years, the number of induced abortions in Hungary is constantly decreasing. However, compared to the number of live births, even today approximately one third of pregnancies conceived eventuate in termination. Various international studies confirm the negative consequences of the intervention exerting influence on women's mental health. The aim of this publication is to give a summary on the psychological aspects of the decision making process in the pre-abortion period, from the diagnosis of pregnancy to the surgical intervention. The authors present a detailed overview on the background for the reasons of the decision, the stages of the period from conception until termination, as well as factors related to difficulties in decision making, and possible psychological consequences

TI  - Does the Outcome of a First Pregnancy Predict Depression, Suicidal Ideation, or Lower Self-Esteem? Data From the National Comorbidity Survey
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPSYCHIATRY
AB  - This study examines the risk of depression, suicidal ideation, and lower self-esteem following an abortion versus a delivery, with and without adjusting for important correlates. Using the National Comorbidity Survey, we tested how first pregnancy outcome (abortion vs. delivery) related to subsequent major depression, suicidal ideation, and self-esteem. Models controlling for risk factors, such as background and economic factors, prepregnancy violence experience, and prepregnancy mental health, as well as a model with all risk factors, were examined. When no risk factors were entered in the model, women who had abortions were more likely to have subsequent depression, OR = 1.53, 95% CI [1.05-2.22], and suicidal ideation, OR = 2.02, 95% CI [1.40-2.92], but they were not more likely to have lower self-esteem, B = -.02. When all risk factors were entered, pregnancy outcome was not significantly related to later depression, OR = 0.87, 95% CI [0.54-1.37], and suicidal ideation, OR = 1.19, 95% CI [0.70-2.02]. Predictors of mental health following abortion and delivery included prepregnancy depression, suicidal ideation, and sexual violence. Policies and practices implemented in response to the claim that abortion hurts women are not supported by our findings. Efforts to support women's mental health should focus on known risk factors, such as gender-based violence and prior mental health problems, rather than abortion history.

TI  - Developing and validating the Psychosocial Burden among people Seeking Abortion Scale (PB-SAS)
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - While there is a large body of research demonstrating that having an abortion is not associated with adverse mental health outcomes, less research has examined which factors may contribute to elevated levels of mental health symptoms at the time of abortion seeking. This study aims to develop and validate a new tool to measure dimensions of psychosocial burden experienced by people seeking abortion in the United States. To develop scale items, we reviewed the literature including existing measures of stress and anxiety and conducted interviews with experts in abortion care and with patients seeking abortion. Thirty-five items were administered to 784 people seeking abortion at four facilities located in three U.S. states. We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to reduce items and identify key domains of psychosocial burden. We assessed the predictive validity of the overall scale and each sub-scale, by assessing their associations with validated measures of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression using multivariable linear regression models. Factor analyses revealed a 12-item factor solution measuring psychosocial burden seeking abortion, with four subdomains: structural challenges, pregnancy decision-making, lack of autonomy, and others' reactions to the pregnancy. The alpha reliability coefficients were acceptable for the overall scale (alpha = 0.83) and each subscale (ranging from alpha = 0.82-0.85). In adjusted analyses, the overall scale was significantly associated with stress, anxiety and depression; each subscale was also significantly associated with each mental health outcome. This new scale offers a practical tool for providers and researchers to empirically document the factors associated with people's psychological well-being at the time of seeking an abortion. Findings suggest that the same restrictions that claim to protect people from mental health harm may be increasing people's psychosocial burden and contributing to adverse psychological outcomes at the time of seeking abortion.

TI  - Induced abortion and anxiety, mood, and substance abuse disorders: Isolating the effects of abortion in the national comorbidity survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine associations between abortion history and a wide range of anxiety (panic disorder, panic attacks, PTSD, Agoraphobia), mood (bipolar disorder, mania, major depression), and substance abuse disorders (alcohol and drug abuse and dependence) using a nationally representative US sample, the national comorbidity survey. Abortion was found to be related to an increased risk for a variety of mental health problems (panic attacks, panic disorder, agoraphobia, PTSD, bipolar disorder, major depression with and without hierarchy), and substance abuse disorders after statistical controls were instituted for a wide range of personal, situational, and demographic variables. Calculation of population attributable risks indicated that abortion was implicated in between 4.3% and 16.6% of the incidence of these disorders. Future research is needed to identify mediating mechanisms linking abortion to various disorders and to understand individual difference factors associated with vulnerability to developing a particular mental health problem after abortion.

TI  - Abortion and mental health: What therapists need to know
T2  - WOMEN & THERAPY
AB  - Unwanted pregnancy and abortion are common life events, and therapists are likely to work with clients who experience them. Legal abortion currently entails little physical or mental health risk most women currently cope effectively with these life events Without need of clinical intervention. But current abortion politics include efforts to make abortion a more threatening, stressful, and stigmatized experience and to create a "postabortion syndrome." Using a stress and coping framework, we examine how antiabortion activists spread myths and misinformation aimed at women's appraisal processes, and discuss approaches therapists call use to enhance women's strategies for coping with abortion. We also discuss specific issues and useful techniques for counseling about abortion concerns, including Cultural sensitivity and strategies for promoting positive Sexual health.

TI  - Abortion and anxiety: What's the relationship?
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Using data from the United States National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) and the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), we conducted secondary data analyses to examine the relationship of abortion, including multiple abortions, to anxiety after first pregnancy outcome in two studies. First, when analyzing the NSFG, we found that pre-pregnancy anxiety symptoms, rape history, age at first pregnancy outcome (abortion vs. delivery), race, marital status, income, education, subsequent abortions, and subsequent deliveries accounted for a significant association initially found between first pregnancy outcome and experiencing subsequent anxiety symptoms. We then tested the relationship of abortion to clinically diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (11151)), and social anxiety disorder, using NCS data. Contrary to findings from our analyses of the NSFG, in the NCS analyses we did not find a significant relationship between first pregnancy outcome and subsequent rates of GAD, social anxiety, or PTSD. However, multiple abortions were found to be associated with much higher rates of PTSD and social anxiety; this relationship was largely explained by pre-pregnancy mental health disorders and their association with higher rates of violence. Researchers and clinicians need to learn more about the relations of violence exposure, mental health, and pregnancy outcome to avoid attributing poor mental health solely to pregnancy outcomes.

TI  - Relationship between perceived stigma and depressive symptomatology in women who legally interrupt pregnancy in Mexico City
T2  - SALUD MENTAL
AB  - Introduction. Although the international literature suggests that women who interrupt a pregnancy in safe conditions do not develop mental health problems, it continues to be a highly stigmatized issue by broad social sectors. It is therefore not surprising that abortion stigma is one of the main factors associated with the presence of mental health problems in women who abort voluntarily. This study explores the association between perceived abortion stigma and depressive symptomatology. Method. In a non-probabilistic convenience sample, 114 users of a Legal Interruption of Pregnancy Clinic in Mexico City were interviewed with a structured instrument. Results. Respondents obtained low scores of internalized stigma and reported feeling confident that they had made the right decision to terminate their pregnancies, and at peace with themselves. The highest scores for abortion stigma were reported in the group with high depressive symptomatology, with no statistically significant differences being observed due to the sociodemographic characteristics explored. The participants in this study were more concerned about what others might think about their decision to terminate a pregnancy and about how their abortion might affect their relationship with them. Discussion and conclusion. These concerns highlight the need to reduce the negative social stigma surrounding abortion and to provide interventions in the same direction among women who interrupt a pregnancy legally in order to reduce the risk of mental health problems such as depression.

TI  - Association between induced abortion and suicidal ideation among unmarried female migrant workers in three metropolitan cities in China: a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Despite reports of mental health issues, suicidality has not been closely examined among the migrant population. The association between induced abortion and suicidal ideation is unknown among unmarried female migrant workers of reproductive age in China. This study aims to examine induced abortion and suicidality among the Chinese migrant population.
   Methods: We recruited 5115 unmarried female migrant workers during 2015 to 2016 from Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, and collected demographic, psychosocial, reproductive and mental health information using structured questionnaires. We used logistic regression models to examine the association between lifetime induced abortion and suicidal ideation during the past year among the subjects.
   Results: Overall, 8.2% of the subjects had suicidal ideation during the past year, and 15.5% of the subjects experienced induced abortion. Induced abortion was associated with nearly twice the odds of having past-year suicidal ideation (Odds ratio, OR = 1.89; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.46, 2.44) after adjusting for age, education, years in the working place, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, daily internet use, attitude towards premarital pregnancy, multiple induced abortion, self-esteem, loneliness, depression, and anxiety disorders. The association was stronger in those aged > 25 (OR = 3.37, 95% CI = 2.16, 5.28), with > 5 years of stay in the working place (OR = 2.98, 95% CI = 2.02, 4.39), the non-anxiety group (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.74, 3.00), and the non-depression group (OR = 2.94, 95% CI = 2.08, 4.15).
   Conclusions: Induced abortion was associated with increased odds for suicidal ideation among the unmarried female migrant workers in urban cities in China. More attention should be paid to the mental health of the population.

TI  - Abortion, mental health and epistemologies of psychological knowledge and ignorance
T2  - SOCIAL AND PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY COMPASS
AB  - This article traces the origins and production of the Post Abortion Syndrome (PAS), a fallacious bio-ideological construct which alleges a link between abortion and mental health risks. Through the work of social actors (anti-abortion activists, policy makers, funders, advocates, and researchers) involved in its construction, this diagnosis was disseminated and diffused into public policy in the US and is used as 'evidence' in deterring people from having abortions. This is despite overwhelming evidence that abortion poses no greater mental health risks than carrying an unintended pregnancy to term. Circulation of this fallacious discourse invalidates, distorts, and homogenizes the lived experiences of reproductive people, contributing to epistemologies of ignorance as pertains to women's health and reproductive experiences. This article examines the invention of PAS, exploring its political underpinnings and ongoing effects. We unearth how psychology and medicine have been coopted to function as handmaidens in passing conservative legislation, attending to the process of willful distortion underpinning this history. Uncovering the systemic nature of the production of ignorance around reproductive people's bodies and psychologies is a necessary step in providing liberatory epistemologies for pregnant people and in enabling individuals to make their own meaning of their abortions.

TI  - Induced abortion and adolescent mental health
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Purpose of review
   Induced abortion is widely believed - by the public, healthcare professionals, and policy-makers - to lead to adverse mental health sequelae. This belief is false, as it applies both to adult women and adolescents. However, it has been used to rationalize, and been quoted in, restrictive and intrusive legislation in several states and in proposed federal legislation. It is essential for gynecologists to have accurate information, as clinicians, for their patients, and, as key experts, for policy makers.
   Recent findings
   New articles concluding that there are adverse psychological outcomes from induced abortion continue to be published. The methodological flaws in these articles are so serious as to invalidate those conclusions. Several recent scholarly analyses detail these flaws. Methodologically sound studies and reviews continue to demonstrate that psychosocial problems play a role in unwanted conception and the decision to abort unwanted pregnancies but are not the result of abortion.
   Summary
   Clinicians may have to reassure patients making decisions about their pregnancies that abortion does not cause psychiatric illness. They can do so on the basis of recent analyses substantiating that finding.

TI  - Abortion and Mental Health Findings From the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a first abortion increases risk of mental health disorders compared with a first childbirth with and without considering prepregnancy mental health and adverse exposures, childhood economic status, miscarriage history, age at first abortion or childbirth, and race or ethnicity.
   METHODS: A cohort study compared rates of mental disorders (anxiety, mood, impulse-control, substance use, eating disorders, and suicidal ideation) among 259 women postabortion and 677 women postchildbirth aged 18-42 years at the time of interview from The National Comorbidity Survey-Replication.
   RESULTS: The percentage of women with no, one, two, and three or more mental health disorders before their first abortion was 37.8%, 19.7%, 15.2%, and 27.3% and before their first childbirth was 57.9%, 19.6%, 9.2%, and 13.3%, respectively, indicating that women in the abortion group had more prior mental health disorders than women in the childbirth group (P,. 001). Although in unadjusted Cox proportional hazard models, abortion compared with childbirth was associated with statistically significant higher hazards of postpregnancy mental health disorders, associations were reduced and became nonstatistically significant for five disorders after adjusting for the aforementioned factors. Hazard ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals dropped from 1.52 (1.08-2.15) to 1.12 (0.87-1.46) for anxiety disorders; from 1.56 (1.23-1.98) to 1.18 (0.88-1.56) for mood disorders; from 1.62 (1.02-2.57) to 1.10 (0.75-1.62) for impulse-control disorders; from 2.53 (1.09-5.86) to 1.82 (0.63-5.25) for eating disorders; and from 1.62 (1.09-2.40) to 1.25 (0.88-1.78) for suicidal ideation. Only the relationship between abortion and substance use disorders remained statistically significant, although the hazard ratio dropped from 3.05 (1.94-4.79) to 2.30 (1.35-3.92).
   CONCLUSIONS: After accounting for confounding factors, abortion was not a statistically significant predictor of subsequent anxiety, mood, impulse-control, and eating disorders or suicidal ideation.

TI  - Nurses in abortion care: Identifying and managing stress
T2  - CONTEMPORARY NURSE
AB  - The psychological impact of abortion on the women undergoing the procedure is well researched, but little is known about the potential psychological impact on nurses working in abortion care.
   The proportion Of medical abortions in the UK is rising compared to surgical abortions. A recent research study found that being more directly involved in the procedure places more emotional demands on the nurses. This emotional labour required by nurses working in abortion care may increase their stress levels.
   This paper examines the potential increase in stress in nurses caused by medical abortions. A model of stress comprising stressors, moderators and stress outcomes was used as a framework for this examination. Research on abortion and mental health nursing was applied to managing stress in abortion care; this included coping mechanisms, prevention and intervention strategies. This showed that stress, burnout and coping are important issues in abortion,care. On this basis, recommendations for practice have been formulated to inform practice for nurses and managers in abortion care.

TI  - Consideration of Abortion in Pregnancy: Demographic Characteristics, Mental Health, and Protective Factors
T2  - WOMEN & HEALTH
AB  - This study examined demographic characteristics, available resources, and mental health outcomes of women who did and did not consider abortion in pregnancy. Using data collected between 1998 and 2000 from 2,937 mothers recruited for the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study, this study examined whether women who did and did not consider abortion differed in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and resources at the birth of their children and mental health outcomes when their children were one year old. This study further examined protective factors associated with low parenting stress at one year postpartum, despite initial abortion consideration. Compared to women who did not consider abortion, women who did consider abortion tended to be younger, have less education and lower income, and report higher levels of substance use, higher perceived support, and lower received support. A subset of women who had higher education, more income, and lower substance use reported lower parenting stress at year one despite abortion consideration in pregnancy. Promotion of education and employment assistance may be particularly important among women experiencing unplanned pregnancies as these services may contribute to lower parenting stress and improved child outcomes.

TI  - Use of psychotropic drugs before pregnancy and the risk for induced abortion: population-based register-data from Finland 1996-2006
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Some, though not all studies have reported an increased risk for mental health problems after an induced abortion. Problems with design and data have compromised these studies and the generalisation of their results.
   Methods: The Finnish Medication and Pregnancy database (N = 622 671 births and 114 518 induced abortions for other than fetal reasons) in 1996-2006 was utilised to study the use of psychotropic drugs in the three months before a pregnancy ending in a birth or an induced abortion.
   Results: In total 2.1% of women with a birth and 5.1% of women with an induced abortion had used a psychotropic medicine 0-3 months before pregnancy. Psychotropic drug users terminated their pregnancies (30.9%) more often than other pregnant women (15.5%). Adjustment for background characteristics explained one third of this elevated risk, but the risk remained significantly increased among users of psychotropic medicine (OR 1.94, 95% confidence intervals 1.87-2.02). A similar risk was found for first pregnancies (30.1% vs. 18.9%; adjusted OR 1.53, 95% confidence intervals 1.42-1.65). The rate for terminating pregnancy was the highest for women using hypnotics and sedatives (35.6% for all pregnancies and 29.1% for first pregnancies), followed by antipsychotics (33.9% and 36.0%) and antidepressants (32.0% and 32.1%).
   Conclusions: The observed increased risk for induced abortion among women with psychotropic medication highlighs the importance to acknowledge the mental health needs of women seeking an induced abortion. Further studies are needed to establish the impact of pre-existing differences in mental health on mental health outcomes of induced abortions compared to outcomes of pregnancies ending in a birth.

TI  - Towards a better understanding of abortion misinformation in the USA: a review of the literature
T2  - CULTURE HEALTH & SEXUALITY
AB  - Roughly 20% of women in the USA will seek an abortion during their lifetimes. As abortion is a medical procedure, individuals seeking abortion services must have access to accurate medical information. Inaccurate information about abortion, known as abortion misinformation, adversely affects knowledge about abortion, and may impair informed decision-making. Abortion misinformation has received limited attention in psychological and health research. This review summarises current findings on abortion misinformation from studies of adults in the USA, examines which forms of misinformation are most common, and assesses prominent sources of abortion misinformation. A narrative, integrative approach was adopted focussing on nine articles. Findings suggest that first, inaccurate beliefs about abortion exist among many samples of US adults, including inaccurate connections between abortion and breast cancer, infertility and negative mental health outcomes. Second, abortion misinformation comes from a variety of informational sources, which may render efforts to prevent it challenging. Summarising and extending knowledge of abortion misinformation may be useful first steps to better understanding this phenomenon and may ultimately aid in reduction of abortion misinformation among individuals living in the USA.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPSYCHIATRY
AB  - In this record-based study, rates of 1st-time Outpatient mental health treatment for 4 years following an abortion or a birth among women receiving medical assistance through the state of California were compared. After controlling for preexisting psychological difficulties, age, months of eligibility, and the number of pregnancies, the rate of care was 17% higher for the abortion group (n = 14,297) in comparison with the birth group (n = 40,122). Within 90 days after the pregnancy, the abortion group had 63% more claims than the birth group, with the percentages equaling 42%, 30%, and 16% for 180 days, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. Additional comparisons between the abortion and birth groups were conducted on the basis of claims for specific types of disorders and age.

TI  - RETRACTED: The Turnaway Study: A Case of Self-Correction in Science Upended by Political Motivation and Unvetted Findings (Retracted article. See vol. 13, 2022)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This review begins with a detailed focus on the Turnaway Study, which addresses associations among early abortion, later abortion, and denied abortion relative to various outcomes including mental health indicators. The Turnaway Study was comprised of 516 women; however, an exact percentage of the population is not discernable due to missing information. Extrapolating from what is known reveals a likely low of 0.32% to a maximum of 3.18% of participants sampled from the available the pool. Motivation for conducting the Turnaway Study, methodological deficiencies (sampling issues and others), and bias are specifically addressed. Despite serious departures from accepted scientific practices, journals in psychology and medicine have published dozens of articles generated from the study's data. The high volume of one-sided publications has stifled dialogue on potential adverse psychological consequences of this common procedure. Following a critical analysis of the Turnaway Study, an overview of the strongest studies on abortion and mental health is offered. This comprehensive literature comprised of numerous large-scale studies from across the globe has been largely overlooked by scientists and the public, while the Turnaway Study dominates the media, information provided to women, and legal challenges involving abortion restrictions. In the final section of this article, literature reviews by professional organizations are considered, demonstrating that the biased science characterizing the Turnaway Study is aligned with a pervasive and systemic phenomenon wherein deriving reliable and valid results via careful attention to methodology and scrutiny by the scientific community have been supplanted by politics.

TI  - Mental Health Diagnoses 3 Years After Receiving or Being Denied an Abortion in the United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objectives. We set out to assess the occurrence of new depression and anxiety diagnoses in women 3 years after they sought an abortion.
   Methods. We conducted semiannual telephone interviews of 956 women who sought abortions from 30 US facilities. Adjusted multivariable discrete-time logistic survival models examined whether the study group (women who obtained abortions just under a facility's gestational age limit, who were denied abortions and carried to term, who were denied abortions and did not carry to term, and who received first-trimester abortions) predicted depression or anxiety onset during seven 6-month time intervals.
   Results. The 3-year cumulative probability of professionally diagnosed depression was 9% to 14%; for anxiety it was 10% to 15%, with no study group differences. Women in the first-trimester group and women denied abortions who did not give birth had greater odds of new self-diagnosed anxiety than did women who obtained abortions just under facility gestational limits.
   Conclusions. Among women seeking abortions near facility gestational limits, those who obtained abortions were at no greater mental health risk than were women who carried an unwanted pregnancy to term.

TI  - COVID-19 and women's health: Examining changes in mental health and fertility
T2  - ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB  - Researchers have speculated that the economic and social consequences of COVID19 will harm women's health. This paper tests this claim in the immediate aftermath of Mexico City's COVID-19 stay-at-home order using call-center data. We use an event-study design to track calls for fertility decisions and mental health. Our findings indicate that mental health worsened during the pandemic. Anxiety calls increased substantially, with the effect being most pronounced for those over 45. Calls related to abortion fell in number, while pregnancy calls remained stable. The abortion effect is most pronounced for women between 15 and 30 and those with a high school degree. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Abortion misinformation from crisis pregnancy centers in North Carolina
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Background: This study assessed the accuracy of medical information provided by crisis pregnancy centers in North Carolina.
   Study Design: We performed a secondary data analysis of a "secret shopper survey" performed by a nonprofit organization. Reports from phone calls and visits to crisis pregnancy centers were analyzed for quality and content of medical information provided. Web sites of crisis pregnancy centers in the state were also reviewed.
   Results: Thirty-two crisis pregnancy centers were contacted. Nineteen of these were visited. Fourteen centers (44%) offered that they "provide counseling on abortion and its risks." Inaccurate information provided included a link between abortion and breast cancer (16%), infertility (26%) and mental health problems (26%). Of the 36 Web sites identified, 31(86%) provided false or misleading information, including 26 sites (72%) linking abortion to "post-abortion stress."
   Conclusions: Many crisis pregnancy centers give inaccurate medical information regarding the risks of abortion. Overstating risks stigmatizes abortion, seeks to intimidate women and is unethical. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Unwanted abortion disclosure and social support in the abortion decision and mental health symptoms: A cross-sectional survey
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Objectives: To assess the extent of unwanted abortion disclosure and levels of social support in the abor-tion decision and their association with depression, anxiety, and stress.Study design: From January to June 2019, we surveyed people presenting for abortion at four clinics in California, New Mexico, and Illinois regarding their experiences accessing abortion. We used multivari-able regression to examine associations between unwanted abortion disclosure and social support in the abortion decision, and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress.Results: Among 1092 people approached, 784 (72% response rate) eligible individuals initiated the survey, and 746 responded to the unwanted abortion disclosure item and were included in analyses. Over one-quarter (27%) told someone they would have preferred not to tell about their decision, mostly due to obstacles getting to the appointment-time to appointment (46%), travel distance (33%), and costs (32%). Three-quarters (74%, n = 546) had at least one person in their life who supported the abortion decision "very much"; 20% had someone who supported the decision "not at all." In adjusted analyses, unwanted abortion disclosure was associated with more symptoms of depression (B = 0.62, 95% confidence interval: 0.28, 0.95), anxiety (B = 1.79; 95% CI: 0.76, 2.82) and stress (B = 1.80, 95% CI: 0.64, 1.72). People also had more symptoms of depression and stress when one or more person (B = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.27, 1.02 and B = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.15, 1.35, respectively) or the man involved in the pregnancy (B = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.16, 1.18 and B = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.13, 1.78, respectively) supported their decision "not at all" (vs "very much" support).Conclusion: Being forced to disclose the abortion decision due to logistical and cost constraints may be harmful to people's mental health. Implications: Logistical burdens such as travel, time to access care, and costs needed to access abortion may force people seeking abortion to involve others who are unsupportive in the abortion decision having negative implications for their mental health.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Long-term incidence and recurrence of common mental disorders after abortion. A Dutch prospective cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - In a previous study (Van Ditzhuijzen et al., 2017) we investigated the incidence and recurrence of mental disorders 2.5 to 3 years post-abortion. The aim of the current study was to extend these findings with longer term follow up data, up until 5-6 years post-abortion. We compared data of women who had had an abortion of the Dutch Abortion and Mental Health Study (DAMHS) to women who did not have an abortion from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2) (N-total = 2227). We used 1-to-1 matching on background confounding variables and measured post-abortion incidence and recurrence of common DSM-IV mental disorders (mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders) using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) version 3.0. After matching on confounding variables, abortion did not increase the likelihood that women had incident or recurrent mental disorders in the 5-6 years post-abortion (any incident mental disorder: OR = 3.66, p = .16; any recurrent mental disorder: OR = 0.22, p = .47). We found no evidence that experiencing an abortion increases the risk on new or recurrent mental disorders on the longer term.

TI  - The Implications of Unintended Pregnancies for Mental Health in Later Life
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Despite decades of research on unintended pregnancies, we know little about the health implications for the women who experience them. Moreover, no study has examined the implications for women whose pregnancies occurred before Roe v. Wade was decided-nor whether the mental health consequences of these unintended pregnancies continue into later life. Using the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, a 60-year ongoing survey, we examined associations between unwanted and mistimed pregnancies and mental health in later life, controlling for factors such as early life socioeconomic conditions, adolescent IQ, and personality. We found that in this cohort of mostly married and White women, who completed their pregnancies before the legalization of abortion, unwanted pregnancies were strongly associated with poorer mental health outcomes in later life.

TI  - Depressive symptoms and anxiety among women with a history of abortion living in urban slums of Bangladesh
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundGlobally, major emphasis has been placed on understanding the physiological consequences of losing a pregnancy. However, its mental health impact on socially disadvantaged women remains unexplored. To further inform the field the present study investigated the prevalence and factors associated with the development of depressive symptoms and anxiety among women with a history of spontaneous abortion living in the urban slums of Dhaka, Bangladesh.MethodsInformation was obtained from 240 women who experienced a spontaneous abortion from July 2020 to December 2021. It was obtained through the urban health and demographic surveillance system (UHDSS) survey. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to measure mental health symptoms. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to assess the associated factors with the mental health outcomes.ResultsOf the 240 women, majority (77.50%) of the women experienced mild to severe depressive symptoms and more than half (58.75%) of the respondants experienced mild to severe anxiety, within one and half years of experiencing spontaneous abortion. A higher level of education and being employed were protective factors for anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. However, women with higher sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR) knowledge had significantly increased anxiety and depressive symptoms. In contrast, receiving post-abortion care (PAC) was associated with decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms.ConclusionThe findings indicate that ensuring access to affordable PAC services and integrating mental health services into the standard PAC service package is crucial. This study also emphasizes the importance of providing education for women living in urban slums and encouraging them to participate in economic activities.

TI  - A comparison of depression and anxiety symptom trajectories between women who had an abortion and women denied one
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background. This study prospectively assesses the mental health outcomes among women seeking abortions, by comparing women having later abortions with women denied abortions, up to 2 years post-abortion seeking.
   Method. We present the first 2 years of a 5-year telephone interview study that is following 956 women who sought an abortion from 30 facilities throughout the USA. We use adjusted linear mixed-effects regression analyses to assess whether symptoms of depression and anxiety, as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory-short form and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire, differ over time among women denied an abortion due to advanced gestational age, compared with women who received abortions.
   Results. Baseline predicted mean depressive symptom scores for women denied abortion (3.07) were similar to women receiving an abortion just below the gestational limit (2.86). Depressive symptoms declined over time, with no difference between groups. Initial predicted mean anxiety symptoms were higher among women denied care (2.59) than among women who had an abortion just below the gestational limit (1.91). Anxiety levels in the two groups declined and converged after 1 year.
   Conclusions. Women who received an abortion had similar or lower levels of depression and anxiety than women denied an abortion. Our findings do not support the notion that abortion is a cause of mental health problems.

TI  - The association between abortion experience and postmenopausal suicidal ideation and mental health: Results from the 5th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES V)
T2  - TAIWANESE JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Objective: The association between abortion and postmenopausal mental health has not been clearly established in Asian women. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of abortion experiences on suicidal ideation and mental health in Korean postmenopausal women.
   Materials and methods: This study included 5133 postmenopausal women registered in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2010 and 2012. Difference in suicidal ideation according to type and number of abortions was analyzed. We used survey multiple logistic regression analysis to evaluate the effect of abortion experiences on the risk for suicidal ideation expressed as adjusted odd ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
   Results: The risk of suicidal ideation was significantly higher in women who experienced more than three abortions (27.9%). While the incidence of suicidal ideation was not significantly affected by the number of spontaneous abortions (p = 0.718), suicidal ideation was significantly more frequent in women who had undergone >= three abortions (p = 0.003). After adjusting for demographic confounding factors, women who underwent >= three induced abortions had higher risk for suicidal ideation (OR: 1.510; 95% CI: 1.189-1.919; p = 0.031). This risk remained elevated even after controlling for depression (OR: 1.391; 95% CI: 1.1086-1.871, p = 0.002). Moreover, the risk of experiencing a depressive mood in daily life was also increased with increasing number of induced abortions even after controlling for depression (OR: 1.657; 95% CI: 1.274-2.156, p = 0.002).
   Conclusion: Undergoing three or more induced abortions during reproductive age was associated with postmenopausal suicidal ideation, stress, and depression. However, such association was not noted in those with spontaneous abortion, even in women with more miscarriages. Thus, clinicians should evaluate depression and suicidal ideation in women with multiple induced abortions. (C) 2018 Taiwan Association of Obstetrics & Gynecology.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Although undergoing an abortion is stressful for most women, little attention has been given to their psychological wellbeing. This protocol aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and primary effects of a complex intervention to promote positive coping behaviors and alleviate depression symptoms among Chinese women who have undergone an abortion. Methods: A two-arm randomized controlled trial design will be used. Participants will be recruited at their first appointment with the abortion clinic and randomly allocated to receive either the Stress-And-Coping suppoRT (START) intervention (in addition to standard abortion care) or standard care only. All participants will be followed-up at two- and six-weeks post-abortion. Approval has been granted by local and university ethics committees. This research was supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship. Discussion: The results will assist refinement and further evaluations of the START intervention, contribute to improved abortion care practices in China, and enrich the evidence on improving women's psychological well-being following abortion in China.

TI  - Therapeutic termination of pregnancy and women's mental health: Determinants and consequences
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - The therapeutic termination of pregnancy (TToP) is an induced abortion following a diagnosis of medical necessity. TToP is applied to avoid the risk of substantial harm to the mother or in cases of fetal unviability. This type of induced abortion is provided after the second semester of gestation if fetal illness or the pregnancy cause physical danger or pathological mental distress to the mother. Socio-cultural and economic determinants could influence the desire for children and family planning in couples, as well as the use of effective contraception and the choice to perform an induced abortion. Also, pre-existing mental health problems could affect the decision between carrying on a problematic pregnancy or having TToP. Furthermore, the TToP is a reproductive event with an important traumatic burden, but also with an intrinsic therapeutic effect and it can produce different psychological and psychopathological effects on women and couples. The aim of this review is to evaluate what demographic, reproductive and psychopathological determinants are involved in the choice of undergoing a TToP in women. Also, we will examine both positive and negative consequences of this procedure on women's mental health, underlying which factors are related to a worse outcome in order to provide the best clinical support to vulnerable groups.

TI  - Affective and Substance Abuse Disorders Following Abortion by Pregnancy Intention in the United States: A Longitudinal Cohort Study
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Background and Objectives: Psychological outcomes following termination of wanted pregnancies have not previously been studied. Does excluding such abortions affect estimates of psychological distress following abortion? To address this question this study examines long-term psychological outcomes by pregnancy intention (wanted or unwanted) following induced abortion relative to childbirth in the United States. Materials and Methods: Panel data on a nationally-representative cohort of 3935 ever-pregnant women assessed at mean age of 15, 22, and 28 years were examined from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Relative risk (RR) and incident rate ratios (IRR) for time-dynamic mental health outcomes, conditioned by pregnancy intention and abortion exposure, were estimated from population-averaged longitudinal logistic and Poisson regression models, with extensive adjustment for sociodemographic differences, pregnancy and mental health history, and other confounding factors. Outcomes were assessed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Version 4, American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria or another validated index for suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety (affective problems); drug abuse, opioid abuse, alcohol abuse, and cannabis abuse (substance abuse problems); and summary total disorders. Results: Women who terminated one or more wanted pregnancies experienced a 43% higher risk of affective problems (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.3-2.2) relative to childbirth, compared to women terminating only unwanted pregnancies (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.0-1.4). Risks of depression (RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.3-3.8) and suicidality (RR 3.44 95% CI 1.5-7.7) were especially elevated with wanted pregnancy abortion. Relative risk of substance abuse disorders with any abortion was high, at about 2.0, but unaffected by pregnancy intention. Excluding wanted pregnancies artifactually reduced estimates of affective disorders by 72% from unity, substance abuse disorders by 11% from unity, and total disorders by 21% from unity. Conclusions: Excluding wanted pregnancies moderately understates overall risk and strongly understates affective risk of mental health difficulties for women following abortion. Compared to corresponding births, abortions of wanted pregnancies are associated with a greater risk of negative psychological affect, particularly depression and suicide ideation, but not greater risk of substance abuse, than are abortions of unwanted pregnancies. Clinical, research, and policy implications are discussed briefly.

TI  - Negative Abortion Experiences: Predictors and Development of the Post-Abortion Psychological and Relational Adjustment Scale
T2  - ISSUES IN LAW & MEDICINE
AB  - Associations between several personal and contextual predictors of negative post-abortion mental health outcomes were explored using a large national sample of U.S. women who sought out post-abortion care from a crisis pregnancy center. The predictors examined included decisional regret, pregnancy wantedness, various forms of pressure, understanding of the procedure, and satisfaction with counseling provided by the abortion facility. Well-established measures of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse in addition to a newly developed assessment of abortion-related outcomes, the Post-Abortion Psychological and Relational Adjustment Scale (PAPRAS) were employed as the criteria in regression models. All analyses included controls for pre-abortion psychological adjustment and various forms of abuse in addition to a number of demographic variables. When the PAPRAS served as the outcome measure, the abortion context variables as a group accounted for 45.8% of the variance in women's post-abortion psychological and relational adjustment scores. Using the same sets of predictors in a series of regression models and employing established measures of general anxiety, depression, PTSD, alcohol abuse, and substance abuse, 3.5% to 8.8% of the variance was explained. Based on psychometric analysis of the PAPRAS, there is evidence that this newly developed instrument holds promise for addressing the unique post-abortion mental health and relational concerns of women.

TI  - Common mental disorders in late pregnancy in women who wanted or attempted an abortion
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background. In countries where legal abortion is restricted, many unwanted pregnancies are carried to term. Attempting an unsuccessful abortion may influence women's mental health. This study investigated the common mental disorders (CMDs) of depression and anxiety in the third trimester of pregnancy in women who wanted or had attempted an abortion in a poor region of Brazil.
   Method. CMDs were assessed by using the 20-item Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) in all pregnant women aged 18-49 years who were registered with publicly funded primary health care in Recife, Northeast Brazil.
   Results. The study achieved a high response rate and 1121 (98.9%) women completed the interview. The prevalence of CMDs for the sample was 43.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 40.2-46.1], and 63.6% (95% CI 55.4-71.2) among the 13.7% of women who attempted an abortion. The association between CMDs and attempted an abortion [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% CI 1.3-3.1] remained after adjustment for confounders.
   Conclusions. This study found that attempting an abortion in the current pregnancy was associated with CMDs. Good access to family planning programs, including access to contraceptive methods and safe abortion, should help to improve the mental health of women.

Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to critical care providers attending the 20th National Critical Care Conference in Argentina. Results: 149 of 1800 attendees completed the questionnaire, 69 (46.3%) of whom were members of the Argentine Society of Critical Care (ASCC). 122 (81.9%) supported abortion decriminalization in situations excluded from the current law; 142 (95.3%) in cases of congenital defects; 133 (89.3%) in cases of rape; 115 (77.2%) when women's mental health is at risk; 71(47.7%) when pregnancy is unintended; and 61 (40.9%) for economic reasons. 126 (84.6%) supported abortion in public and private institutions, and 121 (81.2%) before 12 weeks of pregnancy. Variables independently associated with abortion support among female versus male attendees were abortion to preserve women's mental health (OR 4.47; 95% Cl, 1.61-12.42; P=0.004) and abortion before 12 weeks of pregnancy (OR 3.93; 95% Cl, 1.29-11.94; P=0.015). Abortion at request was independently associated with ASCC membership (OR 2.63; 95% Cl, 1.07-6.45; P=0.034). Conclusion: Critical care providers would support abortion in situations excluded from the current abortion law and before 12 weeks of pregnancy, in both public and private hospitals.

TI  - Barriers to Abortion Care and Their Consequences For Patients Traveling for Services: Qualitative Findings from Two States
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - CONTEXT: Abortion availability and accessibility vary by state. Especially in areas where services are restricted or limited, some women travel to obtain abortion services in other states. Little is known about the experience of travel to obtain abortion.
   METHODS: In January and February 2015, in-depth interviews were conducted with 29 patients seeking abortion services at six facilities in Michigan and New Mexico. Eligible women were 18 or older, spoke English, and had traveled either across state lines or more than 100 miles within the state. Respondents were asked to describe their experience from pregnancy discovery to the day of the abortion procedure. Barriers to accessing abortion care and consequences of these barriers were identified through inductive and deductive analysis.
   RESULTS: Respondents described 15 barriers to abortion care while traveling to obtain services, and three major consequences of experiencing those barriers. Barriers were grouped into five categories: travel-related logistical issues, system navigation issues, limited clinic options, financial issues, and state or clinic restrictions. Consequences were delays in care, negative mental health impacts and considering self-induction. The experience of barriers complicated the process of obtaining an abortion, but the effect of any individual barrier was unclear. Instead, the experience of multiple barriers appeared to have a compounding effect, resulting in negative consequences for women traveling for abortion.
   CONCLUSION: The amalgamation of barriers to abortion care experienced simultaneously can have significant consequences for patients.

TI  - Exploring treatment preferences for psychological services after abortion among college students
T2  - JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE AND INFANT PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Objective: This study reports on the preferences for psychological treatment after abortion among college students who experienced psychological distress and desired mental health services, and provides validation of the Post Abortion Questionnaire (PAQ) as a measure of abortion intervention preferences. Background: The current study is part of a larger programme of research to develop an effective behavioural intervention for young women who seek treatment for psychological distress after abortion. Based upon an earlier study which found that college women who sought psychological treatment after abortion experienced moderate to severe symptoms of acute and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, this study aimed to identify the components of a behavioural intervention to reduce distress after abortion that a college population would prefer. Methods: Participants were N = 45 self-selected college students from Canada and the United States who experienced psychological stress after abortion and desired psychological treatment. Data were collected from January 2007 to January 2010, and included demographic and reproductive data as well as preferences for interventions to reduce psychological distress after abortion. The study was conducted at the McGill University Student Health Services in Montreal. Results: Principal Components Analyses was used to analyse service components of the PAQ, which identified types of services that students desired, including assistance for unanticipated guilt, spiritual distress, coping, and education to understand their abortion experience. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence to develop targeted post-abortion psychological services for this population, which are generally not available in the clinical setting.

TI  - The impact of psychiatric history on women's pre- and postabortion experiences
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate to what extent psychiatric history affects preabortion decision difficulty, experienced burden, and postabortion emotions and coping. Women with and without a history of mental disorders might respond differently to unwanted pregnancy and subsequent abortion.
   Study design: Women who had an abortion (n=325) were classified as either with or without a history of mental disorders, using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0. The two groups were compared on preabortion doubt, postabortion decision uncertainty, experienced pressure, experienced burden of unwanted pregnancy and abortion, and postabortion emotions, self-efficacy and coping. The study was conducted in the Netherlands. Data were collected using structured face-to-face interviews and analyzed with regression analyses.
   Results: Compared to women without prior mental disorders, women with a psychiatric history were more likely to report higher levels of doubt [odds ratio (OR)=2.30; confidence interval (CI)=1.29-4.09], more burden of the pregnancy (OR=2.23; CI=1.34-3.70) and the abortion (OR=1.93; CI=1.12-3.34) and more negative postabortion emotions (beta=.16; CI=.05.28). They also scored lower on abortion-specific self-efficacy (beta=-.11; CI=-.22 to.00) and higher on emotion-oriented (beta=.22;.11-.33) and avoidance-oriented coping (beta=.12; CI=.01.24). The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of experienced pressure, decision uncertainty and positive postabortion emotions.
   Conclusions: Psychiatric history strongly affects women's pre- and postabortion experiences. Women with a history of mental disorders experience a more stressful pre- and postabortion period in terms of preabortion doubt, burden of pregnancy and abortion, and postabortion emotions, self-efficacy and coping. Implications: Negative abortion experiences may, at least partially, stem from prior or underlying mental health problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Abortion and subsequent depressive symptoms: an analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background. Twenty states currently require that women seeking abortion be counseled on possible psychological responses, with six states stressing negative responses. The majority of research finds that women whose unwanted pregnancies end in abortion do not subsequently have adverse mental health outcomes; scant research examines this relationship for young women.
   Methods. Four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were analyzed. Population-averaged lagged logistic and linear regression models were employed to test the relationship between pregnancy resolution outcome and subsequent depressive symptoms, adjusting for prior depressive symptoms, history of traumatic experiences, and sociodemographic covariates. Depressive symptoms were measured using a nine-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Analyses were conducted among two subsamples of women whose unwanted first pregnancies were resolved in either abortion or live birth: (1) 856 women with an unwanted first pregnancy between Waves 2 and 3; and (2) 438 women with an unwanted first pregnancy between Waves 3 and 4 (unweighted n's).
   Results. In unadjusted and adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses for both subsamples, there was no association between having an abortion after an unwanted first pregnancy and subsequent depressive symptoms. In fully adjusted models, the most recent measure of prior depressive symptoms was consistently associated with subsequent depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions. In a nationally representative, longitudinal dataset, there was no evidence that young women who had abortions were at increased risk of subsequent depressive symptoms compared with those who give birth after an unwanted first pregnancy.

TI  - Ohio survey data assessing perceptions of abortion safety
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Objective: Despite overwhelming data supporting the safety of abortion care in the U.S., public perceptions of abortion safety vary widely. While evidence suggests that the public overestimates abortion risk, few studies have analyzed why people think abortion is safe or unsafe.Study Design: Using data from the Ohio Survey of Women, a representative survey of women aged 18 to 44 years with a residential address in Ohio, we examined responses to 2 questions about abortion safety perceptions: the first asked respondents to rate abortion safety in Ohio, and the second asked respondents why they chose this rating of abortion safety. We analyzed these responses with inductive and deductive approaches.Results: There were 2529 responses, of which 1368 (54%) provided a response to the open-ended question about abortion safety. From this subset, 529 gave open-ended responses indicating that they perceive abortion as safe, with 47% attributing this perception to the procedure being performed by a professional in a regulated environment. In contrast, 370 gave open-ended responses indicating that they perceive abortion as unsafe; the most common explanations referred to health risks (19%) and that safety depends on preexisting health conditions (19%).Conclusion: Many participants perceived abortion as safe because it is performed by professionals in a clinical environment or because of personal experiences with abortion. Those perceiving a lack of safety provided more varied responses, including that abortion was dangerous due to a detrimental effect on mental health or protesters at abortion clinics. Implications: We identified that women have a broad range of reasons for perceiving abortion as safe or unsafe. Providers should be aware of this diversity of abortion safety perceptions so that they can best engage with their patients.This updated characterization of pain experienced during an evidence-based medication abortion regimen may allow for better pain-related counseling, tailoring of opioid prescription practices, and improvement in patient satisfaction.(c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A Women's Health Issue?: Framing Post-Abortion Syndrome in the 1980s
T2  - GENDER AND HISTORY
AB  - In the 1980s, a subset of anti-abortion activists in the US claimed the existence of 'post-abortion syndrome' (PAS), a mental illness resulting from the trauma of abortion. Appropriating vocabulary from 1970s feminist health activism, these anti-abortion activists argued against the main goal of that movement, reproductive justice. Instead, conservative and essentialist PAS activists argued 'aborted women' needed to take control of their health by telling their stories of victimisation. Using interviews, congressional hearings and contemporary texts, this article uses PAS to discuss tensions over women's mental health amid the 1980s' backlash.

TI  - Abortion and depression: A population-based longitudinal study of young women
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Aim: Induced abortion is an experience shared by a large number of women in Norway, but we know little about the likely social or mental health-related implications of undergoing induced abortion. International studies suggest an increased risk of adverse outcomes such as depression, but many studies are weakened by poor design. One particular problem is the lack of control for confounding factors likely to increase the risk of both abortion and depression. The aim of the study was to investigate whether induced abortion was a risk factor for subsequent depression. Methods: A representative sample of women from the normal population (n=768) was monitored between the ages of 15 and 27 years. Questions covered depression, induced abortion and childbirth, as well as sociodemographic variables, family relationships and a number of individual characteristics, such as schooling and occupational history and conduct problems. Results: Young women who reported having had an abortion in their twenties were more likely to score above the cut-off point for depression (odds ratio (OR) 3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-6.1). Controlling for third variables reduced the association, but it remained significant (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.7-5.6). There was no association between teenage abortion and subsequent depression. Conclusions: Young adult women who undergo induced abortion may be at increased risk for subsequent depression.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES
AB  - The implications and effects of restrictive abortion laws depend on the characteristics and motivations of women obtaining abortions. Using secondary analysis of abortion patient data, this article documents substantial diversity in reproductive histories, family responsibilities, resources, and reasons for abortion among minors and adults who differed in marital and parental status. Abortion patients had substantial family responsibilities; nearly half were mothers. Reasons for abortion were related to internal, personal characteristics as well as to external circumstances, but for adult women, external circumstances were particularly salient. Women's abortion decisions reflected a desire to optimize the quality of marriage and childbearing, and to reduce risk of physical, psychological, social, and economic disadvantage for themselves and their existing and future children.

TI  - A Cross-Sectional Study of the Psychosocial Problems Following Abortion
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: Twenty percent of pregnant women undergo an abortion. Reviews of previous studies on the effects of abortion on mental health have been inconclusive. Little research has been carried out in this direction in our country. Aims: This study aims to study the psychological effects of abortions and the associated sociodemographic and other parameters. Setting and Design: It is a cross-sectional study, conducted in five different government hospitals of Hyderabad. Materials and Methods: After identifying the participants, an interview was conducted. First, sociodemographic and other parameters were collected by an interviewer. Then, another interviewer conducted the interview using diagnostic tools ( Impact of Events Scale-Revised [IES-R] and Goldberg Health Questionnaire-12 [GHQ-12]). Analysis was carried out using SPSS software. Results: Sixty cases of spontaneous abortion, 31 therapeutic and 9 elective abortions, were collected. Overall, on GHQ-12, 57% women had no distress, 11% had typical distress, while 14% had more than typical distress, 15% had psychological distress, and 3% of them had severe distress. On IES-R, 16% women had little or no symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD, 57% had several symptoms, while 27% of them were likely to have PTSD. Conclusions: Women who underwent elective abortion showed less distress than the other types. Those that underwent a late abortion were more likely to suffer from psychological distress than those having an early one. The medical history was a significant factor in determining the mental health outcome of the women who underwent abortion.

TI  - Examining the Association of Antidepressant Prescriptions With First Abortion and First Childbirth
T2  - JAMA PSYCHIATRY
AB  - IMPORTANCE The repercussions of abortion for mental health have been used to justify state policies that limit access to abortion in the United States. Much earlier research has relied on self-report of abortion or mental health conditions or on convenience samples. This study uses data that rely on neither.
   OBJECTIVE To examine whether first-trimester first abortion or first childbirth is associated with an increase in women's initiation of a first-time prescription for an antidepressant.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study linked data and identified a cohort of women from Danish population registries who were born in Denmark between January 1, 1980, and December 30, 1994. Overall, 396 397 women were included in this study; of these women, 30 834 had a first-trimester first abortion and 85 592 had a first childbirth.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE First-time antidepressant prescription redemptions were determined and used as indication of an episode of depression or anxiety, and incident rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated comparing women who had an abortion vs women who did not have an abortion and women who had a childbirth vs women who did not have a childbirth.
   RESULTS Of 396 397 women whose data were analyzed, 17 294 (4.4%) had a record of at least 1 first-trimester abortion and no children, 72 052 (18.2%) had at least 1 childbirth and no abortions, 13 540 (3.4%) had at least 1 abortion and 1 childbirth, and 293 511 (74.1%) had neither an abortion nor a childbirth. A total of 59 465 (15.0%) had a record of first antidepressant use. In the basic and fully adjusted models, relative to women who had not had an abortion, women who had a first abortion had a higher risk of first-time antidepressant use. However, the fully adjusted IRRs that compared women who had an abortion with women who did not have an abortion were not statistically different in the year before the abortion (IRR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.38-1.54) and the year after the abortion (IRR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.45-1.62) (P=.10) and decreased as time from the abortion increased (1-5 years: IRR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.19-1.29; >5 years: IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.18). The fully adjusted IRRs that compared women who gave birth with women who did not give birth were lower in the year before childbirth (IRR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.43-0.50) compared with the year after childbirth (IRR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98) (P<.001) and increased as time from the childbirth increased (1-5 years: IRR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.47-1.56; >5 years: IRR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.91-2.09). Across all women in the sample, the strongest risk factors associated with antidepressant use in the fully adjusted model were having a previous psychiatric contact (IRR, 3.70; 95% CI, 3.62-3.78), having previously obtained an antianxiety medication (IRR, 3.03; 95% CI, 2.99-3.10), and having previously obtained antipsychotic medication (IRR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.81-1.96).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Women who have abortions are more likely to use antidepressants compared with women who do not have abortions. However, additional aforementioned findings from this study support the conclusion that increased use of antidepressants is not attributable to having had an abortion but to differences in risk factors for depression. Thus, policies based on the notion that abortion harms women's mental health may be misinformed.

TI  - Psychological responses of women after first-trimester abortion
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: Controversy exists over psychological risks associated with abortion. The objectives of this study were to examine women's emotions, evaluations, and mental health after an abortion, as well as changes over time in these responses and their predictors.
   Methods: Women arriving at 1 of 3 sites for an abortion of a first-trimester unintended pregnancy were randomly approached to participate in a longitudinal study with 4 assessments-1 hour before the abortion, and 1 hour, 1 month, and 2 years after the abortion. Eight hundred eighty-two (85%) of 1043 eligible women approached agreed; 442 (50%) of 882 were followed for 2 years. Preabortion and postabortion depression and self-esteem, postabortion emotions, decision satisfaction, perceived harm and benefit, and posttraumatic stress disorder were assessed. Demographic variables and prior mental health were examined as predictors of postabortion psychological responses.
   Results: Two years postabortion, 301 (72%) of 418 women were satisfied with their decision; 306 (69%) of 441 said they would have the abortion again; 315 (72%) of 440 reported more benefit than harm from their abortion; and 308 (80%) of 386 were not depressed. Six (1%) of 442 reported posttraumatic stress disorder. Depression decreased and self-esteem increased from preabortion to postabortion, but negative emotions increased and decision satisfaction decreased over time. Prepregnancy history of depression was a risk factor for depression, lower self-esteem, and more negative abortion-specific outcomes 2 years postabortion. Younger age and having more children preabortion also predicted more negative abortion evaluations.
   Conclusions: Most women do not experience psychological problems or regret their abortion 2 years postabortion, but some do. Those who do tend to be women with a prior history of depression.

TI  - Correlates of Common Mental Disorders Among Dutch Women Who Have Had an Abortion: A Longitudinal Cohort Study
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - CONTEXT: Credible research has not found any evidence that abortion causes mental disorders. It is not known, however, whether abortion-specific risk indicators and other variables are associated with the incidence or recurrence of mental disorders after abortion.
   METHODS: As part of a prospective cohort study conducted in the Netherlands, 325 women were interviewed between April 2010 and January 2011, between 20 and 40 days after having an abortion; 264 were followed up an average of 2.7 years later. Associations between selected baseline variables and postabortion incident or recurrent mental disorders among the 199 women at risk were investigated using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.
   RESULTS: Thirty-two percent of women at risk of an incident or recurrent mental disorder experienced one after the abortion. In multivariate analyses, no abortion-related variables (e.g., history of multiple abortions, second-trimester abortion, preabortion decision difficulty or uncertainty, and postabortion negative emotions) were associated with experience of any postabortion incident or recurrent mental disorders. The outcome was positively associated with having conceived within an unstable relationship (odds ratio, 3.0), number of negative life events in the past year (1.4) and having a history of mental disorders (2.4).
   CONCLUSIONS: Correlates of postabortion mental disorders were variables that have been identified as general risk factors for mental disorders, which supports the idea that abortion does not pose specific risks to future mental health. Future research should investigate in what way unstable relationships, adverse life events and psychiatric history affect postabortion mental health.

TI  - Legally Induced Abortion: The Demographic Profile and Hazards to the Health of Women
T2  - STUDIES ON ETHNO-MEDICINE
AB  - To review the impact on the health of women of legally induced abortion, this paper draws on the published abortion statistics of Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries to examine the consistency of the demographic pattern of legally induced abortion with the known epidemiology of medical conditions that are abortion related. The age distribution of women having abortions is modelled. The social gradient of abortion is considered. Trends in Parous and Nulliparous abortions are reviewed. Health issues among women post abortion such as mental health and especially depressive illnesses, premature and low-weight births, and breast cancer are discussed so as to identify how the incidence of these conditions might be affected by abortion and indicate the prospects and priorities for future research.

TI  - Adolescent Medical Transition is Ethical: An Analogy with Reproductive Health
T2  - KENNEDY INSTITUTE OF ETHICS JOURNAL
AB  - In this article, I argue that adolescent medical transition is ethical by analogizing it to abortion and birth control. The interventions are similar insofar as they intervene on healthy physiological states by reason of the person???s fundamental self-conception and desired life, and their effectiveness is defined by their ability to achieve patients??? embodiment goals. Since the evidence of mental health benefits is comparable between adolescent medical transition, abortion, and birth control, disallowing transition-related interventions would betray an unacceptable double standard. While great enough risks can override autonomy over fundamental aspects of personal identity, I demonstrate that the available scientific evidence does not corroborate the view that adolescent medical transition is dangerous. Consequently, adolescent medical transition should be recognized as ethical and remain available.

TI  - A need to expand our thinking about "repeat" abortions
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Background: Women who have more than one abortion are often the "targets" for social and clinical interventions geared at preventing "repeat abortions." Such an approach ignores the unique circumstances that may surround each abortion.
   Study Design: We qualitatively analyzed the history of 10 women who have had more than one abortion who were participating in a larger study of women's emotional experiences following abortion. Women were recruited following their initial contact with a postabortion support talk line and from a previously completed study.
   Results: Overall, women in the sample reported that each abortion was different and some abortions were more emotionally difficult than others, suggesting that the phrase "repeat" can be a misnomer and discounts the unique circumstances surrounding each abortion.
   Conclusion: Rather than use the term "repeat abortions," we advocate for the use of the less loaded term "multiple abortions," in which each abortion is understood as a unique experience. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Research on abortion in Brazil: gaps and challenges for the public health field
T2  - CADERNOS DE SAUDE PUBLICA
AB  - This paper provides a review of abortion studies produced in the field of public health in Brazil, highlighting current research gaps and challenges. Most studies focus on women admitted to public hospitals for treatment of incomplete abortion, so their scope is limited to abortions presenting complications. Women's profiles, abortion methods, motives, and immediate consequences for women's physical health are also included. However, there remains a need for studies on the following aspects: measuring abortion incidence; investigating cases of post-abortion complications and death; analyzing the relationship between abortion and contraception; investigating the impact of abortion on women's mental health; and incorporating men's perspectives. There is an urgent need for evaluative research on abortion care in public services. Research results should be disseminated widely, so as to help overcome any ideological bias in the current debate on abortion rights in the country.

T2  - GENERAL HOSPITAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Induced abortion has been practiced in every known society and in every era of history. Psychological concomitants of abortion are as much a product of the social and interpersonal context as of the process itself Though abortion results in the loss of a potential human life, if is not associated with significant psychiatric morbidity, and, in fact, represents for many women - and men - a significant milestone in which they assume responsibility for the direction of their lives for the first time. However, assertions that abortion is psychologically damaging have characterized much of the recent bitter debate over the legality and availability of abortion. It is important that mental health professionals are knowledgeable about the subject of abortion so that they can discuss policy with their patients.

TI  - The association between first abortion and first-time non-fatal suicide attempt: a longitudinal cohort study of Danish population registries
T2  - LANCET PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background Suicidal ideation due to abortion has been used to justify restrictive US abortion policies. Much research examining abortion and mental health has relied on self-report, has had low participation rates, and did not consider confounding factors. In the present study, we used data that do not rely on self-report and are not affected by low participation rates to examine the association between abortion and non-fatal suicide attempts, adjusting for confounding factors.
   Methods In this longitudinal cohort study of Danish population registries, we linked data on a cohort of women born in Denmark between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 30, 1998, who did not die or emigrate from Denmark before their 18th birthday or before study entry. Follow-up started on the woman's 18th birthday or Jan 1, 2000, whichever came last. Follow-up ended at the date of first suicide attempt, date of emigration from Denmark, date of death, or Dec 31, 2016, whichever came first. Women were between the ages of 18 and 36 years during the study period. We used a survival analysis to examine the risk of first suicide attempts or self-harm associated with a first abortion compared with no abortion, in the complete study cohort. To examine incidence rate ratios (IRRs) associated with abortion, we used Poisson regression with the logarithm of woman-years at risk as an offset We also examined whether the risk of suicide attempts changed before and after the abortion, adjusting for age, calendar year, socioeconomic status, and history of childbirth, mental health, parental mental health, and physical health.
   Findings Data on 523 280 women were included in this study. Of these, 48 990 (9.4%) women had a record of at least one first-trimester abortion, and 10 216 (2.0%) had a suicide attempt during the study period. Among 48 990 women who had an abortion, 1402 (2.9%) had a first suicide attempt after the first abortion. In our fully-adjusted model which adjusted for all covariates, the risk of first-time non-fatal suicide attempts was similar in the year before an abortion (IRR 2.46 [95% CI 2. 22-2. 72]) and the year after an abortion (IRR 2.54 [2.29-2.81], p=0.509) compared with women who had not had an abortion, and decreased with increasing time since the abortion (1-5 years IRR 1.90 [1.75-2.06]; >= 5 years IRR 1.73 [1.53-1.96]).
   Interpretation We found that women who had abortions had a higher risk of non-fatal suicide attempts compared with women who did not have an abortion. However, because the increased risk was the same both the year before and after the abortion, it is not attributable to the abortion. Thus, policies based on the notion that abortion increases women's risk of suicide attempts are misinformed. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biased abortion counseling laws and abortion demand
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB  - Since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1992 Casey decision many states have enacted biased abortion counseling laws. These laws mandate that abortion providers furnish to women with unwanted pregnancies state-approved medical information about possible side effects from having an abortion that are false. The most egregious falsehoods are that abortion is linked to mental health problems (e.g., suicide, postabortion traumatic stress syndrome, and depression), breast cancer, infertility and fetal pain. This paper investigates whether these four biased abortion falsehoods have an impact on the demand for abortions in the year 2000. The empirical results find that these four biased abortion falsehoods have no significant impact on the abortion demand of pregnant women of childbearing age (15-44 years), adult pregnant women (18-44 years) or pregnant teen minors (15-17 years). The findings remain robust even after controlling, for regional differences in antiabortion attitudes. (C) 2009 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All tights reserved.

TI  - Decreased suicide rate after induced abortion, after the Current Care Guidelines in Finland 1987-2012
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Aim: Women with a recent induced abortion have a 3-fold risk for suicide, compared to non-pregnant women. The increased risk was recognised in unofficial guidelines (1996) and Current Care Guidelines (2001) on abortion treatment, highlighting the importance of a check-up 2 - 3 weeks after the termination, to monitor for mental health disorders. We studied the suicide trends after induced abortion in 1987 - 2012 in Finland. Methods: We linked the Register on Induced Abortions (N = 284,751) and Cause-of-Death Register (N = 3798 suicides) to identify women who had committed suicide within 1 year after an induced abortion (N = 79). The abortion rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated for 1987 - 1996 (period with no guidelines), 1997 - 2001 (with unofficial guidelines) and 2002 - 2012 (with Current Care Guidelines). Results: The suicide rate after induced abortion declined by 24%, from 32.4/100,000 in 1987 - 1996 to 24.3/100,000 in 1997 - 2001 and then 24.8/100,000 in 2002 - 2012. The age-adjusted suicide rate among women aged 15 - 49 decreased by 13%; from 11.4/100,000 to 10.4/100,000 and 9.9/100,000, respectively. After induced abortions, the suicide rate increased by 30% among teenagers (to 25/100,000), stagnated for women aged 20 - 24 (at 32/100,000), but decreased by 43% (to 21/100,000) for women aged 25 - 49. Conclusions: The excess risk for suicide after induced abortion decreased, but the change was not statistically significant. Women with a recent induced abortion still have a 2-fold suicide risk. A mandatory check-up may decrease this risk. The causes for the increased suicide risk, including mental health prior to pregnancy and the social circumstances, should be investigated further.

TI  - Women's Mental Health and Well-being 5 Years After Receiving or Being Denied an Abortion A Prospective, Longitudinal Cohort Study
T2  - JAMA PSYCHIATRY
AB  - IMPORTANCE The idea that abortion leads to adverse psychological outcomes has been the basis for legislation mandating counseling before obtaining an abortion and other policies to restrict access to abortion.
   OBJECTIVE To assess women's psychological well-being 5 years after receiving or being denied an abortion.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study presents data from the Turnaway Study, a prospective longitudinal study with a quasi-experimental design. Women were recruited from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2010, from 30 abortion facilities in 21 states throughout the United States, interviewed via telephone 1 week after seeking an abortion, and then interviewed semiannually for 5 years, totaling 11 interview waves. Interviews were completed January 31, 2016. We examined the psychological trajectories of women who received abortions just under the facility's gestational limit (near-limit group) and compared them with women who sought but were denied an abortion because they were just beyond the facility gestational limit (turnaway group, which includes the turnaway-birth and turnaway-no-birth groups). We used mixed effects linear and logistic regression analyses to assess whether psychological trajectories differed by study group.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We included 6 measures of mental health and well-being: 2 measures of depression and 2 measures of anxiety assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory, as well as self-esteem, and life satisfaction.
   RESULTS Of the 956 women (mean [SD] age, 24.9 [5.8] years) in the study, at 1 week after seeking an abortion, compared with the near-limit group, women denied an abortion reported more anxiety symptoms (turnaway-births, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.01 to 1.13; turnaway-no-births, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.39 to 3.18), lower self-esteem (turnaway-births, -0.33; 95% CI, -0.56 to -0.09; turnaway-no-births, -0.40; 95% CI, -0.78 to -0.02), lower life satisfaction (turnaway-births, -0.16; 95% CI, -0.38 to 0.06; turnaway-no-births, -0.41; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.06), and similar levels of depression (turnaway-births, 0.13; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.72; turnaway-no-births, 0.44; 95% CI, -0.50 to 1.39).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, compared with having an abortion, being denied an abortion may be associated with greater risk of initially experiencing adverse psychological outcomes. Psychological well-being improved over time so that both groups of women eventually converged. These findings do not support policies that restrict women's access to abortion on the basis that abortion harms women's mental health.

TI  - Terminating a Wanted Pregnancy: A Feminist, Analytic Autoethnographic Account
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY
AB  - With screening for fetal anomaly becoming more common, more families are faced with making decisions based on receiving fetal anomaly diagnoses after the first trimester. After receiving a diagnosis of fetal anomaly, which is typically associated with shock and denial, pregnant people and couples immediately become faced with a difficult decision of either continuing or terminating the pregnancy. Once a pregnancy termination decision has been made, following abortion of a wanted pregnancy, feelings of grief and sadness are common. While research has been done on the impact of decision-making and mental health diagnoses pre- and post-terminating a wanted pregnancy, there has been little research detailing effective coping strategies for dealing with these unexpected and devastating circumstances. The current study is a feminist analytic autoethnography, which details the experience of my own abortion through a reflexive account. I aim to explore my own methods of coping that were successful as I overcame grief, guilt, and anxiety after terminating my wanted pregnancy due to a fetal anomaly.

TI  - Miscarriage, Religious Participation, and Mental Health
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION
AB  - Approximately 15-20 percent of pregnancies result in miscarriage, yet pregnancy loss remains a socially taboo topic and one that has received limited attention in the literature. Utilizing nationally representative longitudinal data from the NLSY97, this study examines the influence of miscarriage on mental health and whether this relationship is moderated by religious participation. Results from this study suggest that miscarriage is associated with lower mental health among women who also experience a live birth. Results also suggest that religious participation moderates the relationship between miscarriage and mental health; religion is more likely to lead to increases in mental health among women who experience a miscarriage than among women who do not experience a miscarriage. Overall, evidence suggests that religion may be an important coping mechanism for women who deal with pregnancy loss.

TI  - Violence in the lives of women having abortions: Implications for practice and public policy
T2  - PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY-RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
AB  - What do professional psychologists need to know to treat women who once had an abortion? Analyses of responses from 2,525 women revealed that women who reported an abortion were more likely than others to report symptoms of depression and lower life satisfaction. However, they were also more likely to experience rape. childhood physical and sexual abuse, and a violent partner. When history of abuse, partner characteristics, and background variables were controlled, abortion was not related to poorer mental health. This underscores the need to explore the effects of violence in women's lives to avoid misattributing psychological distress to abortion experiences.

TI  - Emotions over five years after denial of abortion in the United States: Contextualizing the effects of abortion denial on women's health and lives
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The Turnaway Study was the first to follow women denied abortions because of state law or facility policy over five years. The study has found negative effects on women's socioeconomic status, physical health, and on their children's wellbeing. However, women did not suffer lasting mental health consequences, prompting questions about the effects of denial on women's emotions.
   Methods: In this mixed methods study, we used quantitative and qualitative interview data from the Turnaway Study to offer insight into these findings. We surveyed 161 women who were denied abortions at 30 facilities across the United States between 2008 and 2010 one week after the abortion denial and semiannually over five years. Mixed-effects regression analyses examined emotions about having been denied the abortion over time. To contextualize the quantitative findings, we draw on in-depth qualitative interviews with 15 participants, conducted in 2014-2015, for their accounts of their emotions and feelings over time.
   Results: Survey participants reported both negative and positive emotions about the abortion denial one week after. Emotions became significantly less negative and more positive over their pregnancy and after childbirth. In multivariable models, lower social support, more difficulty deciding to seek abortion, and placing the baby for adoption were associated with reporting more negative emotions. Interviews revealed how, for some, belief in antiabortion narratives contributed to initial positive emotions. Subsequent positive life events and bonding with the child also led to positive retrospective evaluations of the denial.
   Conclusions: Findings of emergent positive emotions about having been denied an abortion suggest that individuals are able to cope emotionally with an abortion denial, although evidence that policies leading to abortion denial cause significant health and socioeconomic harms remains.

TI  - Associations Between Unintended Pregnancy, Domestic Violence, and Sexual Assault in a Population of Queensland Women
T2  - PSYCHIATRY PSYCHOLOGY AND LAW
AB  - This study aimed to establish the proportion of women seeking information regarding unintended pregnancy in the context of domestic violence (DV) and/or sexual assault (SA) experiences in Queensland. Mental health, sociodemographic variables, and gestation at first and repeated contacts were examined for 6249 women primarily seeking information regarding abortion options during an unintended pregnancy over the 5-year period from July 2012 to June 2017. Reports of DV and SA and associations with mental health issues increased significantly across the 5 years. First contact rates of disclosure were 12.2% for DV and 3% for SA, and higher among repeat contacts (38.1% for DV and 14.1% for SA), with recurring contact facilitating violence disclosure. Restricting access to abortions in the context of violence impedes a woman's agency in attempts to separate from violence and highlights the need for safe, supportive, and accessible services, to assist in screening and assisting with violence.

TI  - Women's demand for late-term abortion - A social or psychiatric issue?
T2  - VOJNOSANITETSKI PREGLED
AB  - Introduction/Aim. Induced termination of unwanted pregnancy after 12th gestational week (late-term abortion) is legally restricted in Serbia as well as in many other countries. On the other hand, unwanted pregnancy very often brings women into the state of personal crisis. Psychiatric indications for legally approved late-term abortion on women's demand include only severe psychiatric disorders. The aim of this paper was to compare sociodemographic, psychological characteristics and claimed reasons for abortion in the two groups of women with late-term demand for abortion the group of women satisfying legally prescribed mental health indications, and the group of women not satisfying these indications. The aim of the study was also to determine predictive validity of the abovementioned parameters for late-term abortion as the outcome of unwanted pregnancy. Methods. A total of 62 pregnant women with demand for late-term abortion were divided into two groups according to the criteria of satisfying or not satisfying legally proposed psychiatric indications for late-term abortion after psychiatric evaluation. For the assessment of sociodemographic and psychological parameters sociodemographic questionnaire and symptom checklist - 90 revised (SCL-90 (R)) scale were used, respectively. The outcome of unwanted pregnancy was followed 6 months after the initial assessment. Results. The obtained results showed a statistically significant difference between the groups in educational level, satisfaction with financial situation, elevated anxiety and distress reactions. Unfavorable social circumstances were the main reason for an abortion in both groups and were predictive for an abortion. A 6-month follow-up showed that women had abortion despite legal restrictions. Conclusion. Pregnant women with psychiatric indication for late-term abortion belong to lower socioeconomic and educational level group compared to women without this indication who have more frequently elevated anxiety and distress reactions to unwanted pregnancy. It is necessary to have more accurate guidelines for mental health indications for legally approved late-term abortion, respecting social circumstances. Preventive measures are of great importance in order to lower the risk of illegally performed late-term abortions.

TI  - Abortion as stigma: Cognitive and emotional implications of concealment
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This study examined the stigma of abortion and psychological implications of concealment among 442 women followed for 2 years from the day of their abortion. As predicted, women who felt stigmatized by abortion were more likely to feel a need to keep it a secret from family and friends. Secrecy was related positively to suppressing thoughts of the abortion and negatively to disclosing abortion-related emotions to others. Greater thought suppression was associated with experiencing more intrusive thoughts of the abortion. Both suppression and intrusive thoughts, in turn, were positively related to increases in psychological distress over time. Emotional disclosure moderated the association between intrusive thoughts and distress. Disclosure was associated with decreases in distress among women experiencing intrusive thoughts of their abortion, but was unrelated to distress among women not experiencing intrusive thoughts.

TI  - Crisis pregnancy center websites: Information, misinformation and disinformation
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
CP  - Annual Meeting of the Society-of-Family-Planning
AB  - Objective: Most states with 24-h waiting periods prior to abortion provide state resource directories to women seeking abortion. Our objective was to evaluate the information on abortion provided on the websites of crisis pregnancy centers listed in these resource directories.
   Study design: We performed a survey of the websites of crisis pregnancy centers referenced in state resource directories for pregnant women. We searched for these state-provided resource directories online. We contacted state Departments of Health and Human Services for a print copy when a directory could not be found online. The crisis pregnancy center websites were evaluated for the information provided on abortion. Standardized data collection tools were used. Descriptive statistics were generated.
   Results: Resource directories of 12 states were procured. A total of 254 websites referring to 348 crisis pregnancy centers were identified. Overall, a total of 203/254 [80%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 75%-84%] of websites provided at least one false or misleading piece of information. The most common misleading or false information included on the websites were a declared link between abortion and mental health risks (122/254 sites; 48%, 95% CI 42%-54%), preterm birth (54/254; 21%, 95% CI 17%-27%), breast cancer (51/254; 20%, 95% CI 16%-25%) and future infertility (32/254; 13%, 95% CI 9%-17%).
   Conclusion: Most crisis pregnancy centers listed in state resource directories for pregnant women provide misleading or false information regarding the risks of abortion. States should not list agencies that provide inaccurate information as resources in their directories. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Neuroticism-related personality traits are associated with posttraumatic stress after abortion: findings from a Swedish multi-center cohort study
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background: Most women who choose to terminate a pregnancy cope well following an abortion, although some women experience severe psychological distress. The general interpretation in the field is that the most consistent predictor of mental disorders after induced abortion is the mental health issues that women present with prior to the abortion. We have previously demonstrated that few women develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) after induced abortion. Neuroticism is one predictor of importance for PTSD, and may thus be relevant as a risk factor for the development of PTSD or PTSS after abortion. We therefore compared Neuroticism-related personality trait scores of women who developed PTSD or PTSS after abortion to those of women with no evidence of PTSD or PTSS before or after the abortion.
   Methods: A Swedish multi-center cohort study including six Obstetrics and Gynecology Departments, where 1294 abortion-seeking women were included. The Screen Questionnaire-Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (SQ-PTSD) was used to evaluate PTSD and PTSS. Measurements were made at the first visit and at three and six month after the abortion. The Swedish universities Scales of Personality (SSP) was used for assessment of Neuroticism-related personality traits. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the risk factors for development of PTSD or PTSS post abortion.
   Results: Women who developed PTSD or PTSS after the abortion had higher scores than the comparison group on several of the personality traits associated with Neuroticism, specifically Somatic Trait Anxiety, Psychic Trait Anxiety, Stress Susceptibility and Embitterment. Women who reported high, or very high, scores on Neuroticism had adjusted odds ratios for PTSD/PTSS development of 2.6 (CI 95% 1.2-5.6) and 2.9 (CI 95% 1.3-6.6), respectively.
   Conclusion: High scores on Neuroticism-related personality traits influence the risk of PTSD or PTSS post abortion. This finding supports the argument that the most consistent predictor of mental disorders after abortion is pre-existing mental health status.

TI  - Relationship between induced abortion and the incidence of depression, anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, and somatoform disorder in Germany
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - Aim: The goal of this retrospective cohort study was to analyze the relationship between induced abortion and the incidence of depression, anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, and somatoform disorder in Germany.
   Methods: Women who had undergone induced abortions for the first time in 281 gynecological practices in Germany between January 2007 and December 2016 were included (index date). Women with live births were matched (1:1) to those with induced abortion by age, index year, and physician. The main outcome of the study was the incidence of depression, anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, and somatoform disorder as a function of induced abortion. Survival analyses and Cox regression models were used to investigate the association between induced abortion and psychiatric disorders.
   Results: This study included 17581 women who had had an induced abortion and 17581 women who had had a live birth. Within 10 years of the index date, 6.7% of the participants with induced abortions and 5.4% of those with live births were diagnosed with depression (log-rank p-value = 0.003). The respective figures were 3.4% and 2.7% for anxiety disorder (log-rank p-value = 0.255), 6.2% and 5.6% for adjustment disorder (log-rank p-value = 0.116), and 19.3% and 13.3% for somatoform disorder (log-rank p-value < 0.001). Induced abortion was significantly associated with depression (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.34), adjustment disorder (HR = 1.45) and somatoform disorder (HR = 1.56), but not with anxiety disorder (HR = 1.17).
   Conclusions: There was a positive association between induced abortion and several psychiatric disorders in Germany. Further analyses are recommended to assess how induced abortion can have such a negative impact on mental health.

TI  - Prevalence of stress and depression and associated factors among women seeking a first-trimester induced abortion in China: a cross-sectional study
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Plain language summary Abortion is a stressful life event. Understanding how women perceive having an abortion and their psychosocial responses will enable health providers to understand women's needs and provide high-quality care. This study aims to determine the frequency of stress and depression among women seeking an induced abortion in early pregnancy in China and associated factors Around 25.3% of women reported high stress and 22.5% reported depression. Women were more likely to suffer high stress if they reported low resilience, were not-using contraceptives, had low social support, were non-local residents, were unhappy with their intimate relationship, or held pro-life attitudes towards abortion. High perceived stress, high education level, and non-local status were associated with depression. The findings indicate stress and depression are quite common among women seeking an abortion in China, especially those with high-risk factors. It is necessary to evaluate and promote the mental health of women seeking an abortion.
   Objectives To determine the prevalence of stress and depression and associated factors among women seeking a first-trimester induced abortion in China. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Beijing, from April 1st to Oct 31st, 2021. Women seeking termination of an intrauterine first-trimester pregnancy were invited to participate and complete a digital self-administered questionnaire. The survey included socio-demographic and health questions, Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Descriptive analyses and binary logistic regression analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0. Results A total of 253 women participated. Prevalence of high perceived stress (cut-off >= 20) and depressive symptoms (cut-off >= 10) was 25.3% and 22.5%, respectively. Women were more likely to suffer high stress if they reported low resilience (aOR = 16.84, 95% CI 5.18-54.79), were not-using contraceptives (aOR = 3.27, 95% CI 1.39-6.29), had low social support (aOR = 2.95, 95% CI 1.39-6.29), were non-local residents (aOR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.15-5.92), were dissatisfied with their intimate relationship (aOR = 2.44, 95% CI 1.15-5.16), or held pro-life attitudes towards abortion (aOR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.18-3.53). Odds of experiencing depression were higher among women who also reported high perceived stress (aOR = 19.00, 95% CI 7.67-47.09), had completed higher education (aOR = 12.28, 95% CI 1.24-121.20), and were non-local residents (aOR = 3.38, 95% CI 1.37-8.32). Conclusions The magnitude of perceived stress and depression was high among Chinese women seeking a first-trimester induced abortion. It is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the mental health of women seeking an abortion, especially those with high risk. Interventions to mitigate relevant associated factors could improve the psychological wellbeing of women.

TI  - Born unwanted, 35 years later: The Prague study
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS
AB  - A long-held belief among mental health practitioners is that being born unwanted carries a risk of negative psychosocial development and poor mental health in adulthood. The Prague Study was designed to test this hypothesis. It followed the development and mental well-being of 220 children (now adults) born in 1961-63 in Prague to women twice denied abortion for the same unwanted pregnancy. The children were individually pair-matched at about age nine with 220 children born from accepted pregnancies when no abortion had been requested. This article brings together in one place the theoretical assumptions and hypotheses, the criteria for selecting the study participants and major findings from five follow-up waves conducted among the children around the ages of 9, 14-16, 21-23, 28-31 and 32-35 years, plus a sub-study of married unwanted pregnancy subjects and accepted pregnancy controls at ages 26-28. To control for potential confounding factors in data interpretation, all siblings of all subjects were included in the last two waves. It was found that differences in psychosocial development widened over time but lessened at around age 30. All the differences consistently disfovoured the unwanted pregnancy subjects, especially only children (no siblings). They became psychiatric patients (especially in-patients) more frequently than the accepted pregnancy controls and also more often than their siblings. The overall findings suggest that, in the aggregate, denial of abortion for unwanted pregnancy entails an increased risk for negative psychosocial development and mental well-being in adulthood.

TI  - The relationship of abortion to well-being: Do race and religion make a difference?
T2  - PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY-RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
AB  - Relationships of abortion and childbearing to well-being were examined for 1,189 Black and 3,147 White women. Education, income, and having a work role were positively and independently related to well-being for all women. Abortion did not have an independent relationship to well-being, regardless of race or religion, when well-being before becoming pregnant was controlled. These findings suggest professional psychologists should explore the origins of women's mental health problems in experiences predating their experience with abortion, and they can assist psychologists in working to ensure that mandated scripts from ''informed consent'' legislation do not misrepresent scientific findings.

TI  - Born Unwanted: Mental Health Costs and Consequences
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPSYCHIATRY
AB  - Grounded in the concepts of intendedness and wantedness and research on children born to women denied abortion, this article focuses on the Prague Study, which followed the development and mental well-being over 35 years of 220 children born between 1961 and 1963 in Prague, Czech Republic, to women twice denied abortion for the same unwanted pregnancy. Children were individually pair-matched at age 9 with 220 children born from accepted pregnancies. Five follow-up waves were conducted at ages 9, 14-16, 21-23, 28-31, and 32-35 years. A substudy was also conducted of married unwanted pregnancy and accepted pregnancy participants at ages 26-28 years. To control for potential confounding factors, the study included all siblings of all subjects in the last 2 waves. Differences in psychosocial development widened over time but lessened around age 30. All the differences were consistently in disfavor of the unwanted pregnancy participants, especially for only children (no siblings). They became psychiatric patients more frequently than the accepted pregnancy controls and also more often than their siblings. In the aggregate, denial of abortion for unwanted pregnancies entails an increased risk for negative psychosocial development and mental well-being in adulthood. Implications for public health policy are discussed.

TI  - The mental health of adults born of unwanted pregnancies, their siblings, and matched controls: A 35-year follow-up study from Prague, Czech Republic
T2  - JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that being born of an unwanted pregnancy is a risk factor for poor mental health in adulthood. Self-report and objective data were collected at ages 28 to 31 and 32 to 35 years in a cohort of nearly 200 "unwanted" subjects born after their mothers had been twice denied an abortion for the same pregnancy. The same data were collected in a sociodemographically matched control cohort of "accepted" subjects whose mothers had not requested an abortion, and from siblings of both the unwanted subjects and the accepted control subjects. Logistic regression analyses conducted with several indicators of poor mental health in adulthood as dependent variables brought partial support for the hypothesis. Specifically, unwanted subjects became psychiatric patients (especially psychiatric inpatients) more frequently than their siblings and the accepted controls. Criminality, alcohol-related disorders, and heavy smoking were not associated with unwanted pregnancy.

TI  - Access to Safe Legal Abortion in Malaysia: Women's Insights and Health Sector Response
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Malaysia has an abortion law, which permits termination of pregnancy to save a woman's life and to preserve her physical and mental health (Penal Code Section 312, amended in 1989). However, lack of clear interpretation and understanding of the law results in women facing difficulties in accessing abortion information and services. Some health care providers were unaware of the legalities of abortion in Malaysia and influenced by their personal beliefs with regard to provision of abortion services. Accessibility to safer abortion techniques is also an issue. The development of the 2012 Guidelines on Termination of Pregnancy and Guidelines for Management of Sexual and Reproductive Health among Adolescents in Health Clinics by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia, is a step forward toward increasing women's accessibility to safe abortion services in Malaysia. This article provides an account of women's accessibility to abortion in Malaysia and the health sector response in addressing the barriers.

TI  - Is Sex-Selective Abortion against the Law?
T2  - OXFORD JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES
AB  - The article addresses the legal status of 'sex-selective' abortion in British law. It argues, firstly, that abortions for which knowledge of fetal sex is a 'but-for' cause can be lawful under the terms of the Abortion Act 1967, so long as one of the physical or mental health grounds in section 1 of the Act is attested to in good faith by two medical professionals. The failure of governmental and health bodies to correctly state the law pertaining to sex-selective abortion in recent years owes in part to the failure to distinguish the legal grounds for abortion from the factual explanations for abortion, a distinction which, I argue, is essential for understanding the structure of Britain's abortion law. The article also considers the claim that abortions carried out partly for reasons of fetal sex are unlawful, or, if not, ought to be legally prohibited, because of reasonable doubts about patient consent. It points out some key ways in which this consent-based objection is difficult to square with our general abortion permissions.

TI  - Abortion Knowledge and Attitudes Among Psychologists and Graduate Students
T2  - COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGIST
AB  - Abortion is often misunderstood and steeped in misinformation. Laypeople and medical professionals tend to have limited abortion knowledge. Among the public, individuals who hold accurate information about abortion are more likely to endorse pro-choice attitudes than individuals who are misinformed. We explored knowledge of, and attitudes toward, abortion among 142 psychologists and graduate students. Participants responded accurately, on average, to 68% of the items on a true-false measure of abortion knowledge. In addition, participants with higher levels of accurate knowledge were more likely to endorse pro-choice attitudes. Participants were especially likely to incorrectly answer items related to the prevalence, availability, and current legality of abortion in the United States. Analyzing qualitative interviews with a subset of 13 participants, we generated four themes related to knowledge and attitudes about abortion: Assuming Proficiency Despite Minimal Training, Pursuing Outside Knowledge and Training, Framing Abortion Around Identities, and Perceiving and Experiencing Consequences from Abortion Attitudes. Implications for training are delineated.

TI  - Abortion as a human right: The struggle to implement the abortion law in Colombia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
AB  - In 2006, a Colombian Constitutional Court decision legalized abortion in cases of risk to a woman's physical or mental health, fetal malformation incompatible with life, or rape or incest. This decision resulted from legal action brought by feminist groups, and frames abortion as a human right. Advocates played a key role in implementing the new law by educating providers and the public about its broad interpretations. Healthcare providers and facilities did not have an organized response to the new law. Nonprofit organizations filled this gap, and provide a majority of legal abortions throughout the country. Civil society facilitated implementation of the new law by providing legal accompaniment to women facing barriers to accessing abortions. Despite these efforts, few legal abortions are performed each year, and clandestine, often unsafe abortions continue to prevail. Lack of information about the new law, stigma, and fluctuating political will remain key barriers.

TI  - Homelessness, housing instability, and abortion outcomes at an urban abortion clinic in the United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse reproductive health outcomes are well documented among people experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Little is known about abortion outcomes among this population.
   OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between housing status and abortion outcomes and whether gestational age mediates this relationship.
   STUDY DESIGN: Our sample comprised 1903 individuals who had abortions at an urban clinic in San Francisco, CA, from 2015 to 2017. We defined homelessness or housing instability as a binary exposure, which included staying outside, with friends and/or family, or in a tent, vehicle, shelter, transitional program, or hotel. We evaluated gestational duration of >= 20 weeks as a mediator variable. Our primary outcome was any abortion complication. Logistic regression models were adjusted for age, race, substance use, mental health diagnoses, and previous vaginal and cesarean deliveries.
   RESULTS: Approximately 19% (n=356) of abortions were among people experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Compared with those with stable housing, people experiencing homelessness or housing instability presented later in pregnancy (mean gestational duration, 13.3 vs 9.5 weeks; P<.001) and had more frequent complications (6.5% vs 2.8%; P<.001; odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.9). Adjusting for race, substance use, mental health diagnoses, and previous cesarean deliveries, individuals experiencing homelessness or housing instability were more likely to have abortion complications (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-4.0). However, the relationship was attenuated after adjusting for gestational duration (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-2.6), suggesting that gestational duration mediates the relationship between housing status and abortion complications.
   CONCLUSION: Patients experiencing homelessness or housing instability presented later in gestation, which seems to contribute to the increased frequency of abortion complications.

TI  - How women anticipate coping after an abortion
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Background: There has been some study of women's emotional and psychological well-being after an abortion but no research into women's expectations, at the time of seeking an abortion, of how they will cope after the abortion.
   Study Design: We abstracted counseling needs assessment forms of 5109 women who sought an abortion at a clinic in 2008.
   Results: The most common emotions that women anticipate feeling after their abortion are relieved (63%) and confident (52%). A significant minority anticipate feeling a little sad (24%) and a little guilty (21%); 3.4% anticipate poor coping. Women with fetal abnormalities, women who do not have high confidence in their decision, women who have spiritual concerns about abortion, women with a history of depression, women who feel that they were pushed into having an abortion and teenagers are more likely to anticipate poor coping postabortion.
   Conclusions: The vast majority of women expect to cope well after their abortion. A small number make the decision to terminate their pregnancies even though they anticipate difficulty coping after the procedure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Abortion Decisions as Humanizing Acts: The Application of Ambivalent Sexism and Objectification to Women-Centered Anti-Abortion Rhetoric
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY
AB  - Women-centered anti-abortion rhetoric, grounded in ostensibly positive beliefs that pregnant people are precious objects who must be protected from having abortions, has proliferated anti-abortion activism and legislation. However, abortion stigma, marked by negative perceptions of people who terminate pregnancies, is the most widely used theoretical tool for understanding the social and psychological implications of abortion. In this article, we first integrate these two seemingly contradictory perspectives on abortion through the lens of ambivalent sexism theory. We then argue that ambivalent sexism paves the way for objectifying perceptions and treatment of pregnant people; specifically, our typology of reproductive objectification provides a tool for exploring how the abortion decision-making of pregnant people is undermined. Through this lens, abortion decisions can represent a subversion of these portrayals and treatment by affirming people who seek and have abortions as whole human beings. Throughout, we aim to counter White supremacy and cisheteropatriarchy, which have marked public discourse and psychological research on abortion. Finally, using this reproductive objectification framework, recommendations for clinicians and researchers are provided.

TI  - Women's experiences when unsure about whether or not to have an abortion in the first trimester
T2  - HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Abortion during the first trimester is legal in most Western countries. However, deciding to terminate a pregnancy is a challenging process, and some women arrive at the abortion clinic still not absolutely certain. We explored the experiences of 13 pregnant Norwegian women struggling to finalize their decision, interviewing them before and after their decision. Verification of the pregnancy meant a new reality for the women. They started to consider their readiness, describing the experience as a lonely journey during which their values were challenged. A feeling of existential loneliness dominated the decision-making process and the implementation.

TI  - WHOLE WOMAN'S HEALTH V. HELLERSTEDT: THE EMPIRICAL CASE AGAINST TRAP LAWS
T2  - MEDICAL LAW REVIEW
AB  - This commentary examines the US Supreme Court case Whole Woman's Health v Hellerstedt.(1) This comment synthesizes the case, focusing primarily on its legislative and appellate history as well as the Supreme Court's analysis. The comment finds that while Whole Woman's Health represented a judicial victory for those who seek to safeguard and preserve abortion rights, it nevertheless further rooted the primacy of the Supreme Court's flawed framework in Planned Parenthood v Casey(2), which rests on perpetuating the notion of abortion as a threat against women's physical and mental health.

TI  - First-Time First-Trimester Induced Abortion and Risk of Readmission to a Psychiatric Hospital in Women With a History of Treated Mental Disorder
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Context: Mental health problems are associated with women's reproductive decisions and predict poor mental health outcomes after abortion and childbirth.
   Objectives: To study whether having a first-trimester induced abortion influenced the risk of psychiatric readmission and compare findings with readmission risk in women with mental disorders giving birth.
   Design: Survival analyses were performed in a population-based cohort study merging data from the Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, and the Danish National Hospital Register from January 1,1994, to December 31., 2007.
   Setting: Denmark.
   Participants: All women born in Denmark between 1962 and 1992 with a record of 1 or more psychiatric admissions at least. 9 months before a first-time first-trimester induced abortion or childbirth.
   Main Outcome Measure: Readmission at a psychiatric hospital with any type of mental disorder from 9 months before to 12 months after a first-time first-trimester induced abortion or childbirth.
   Results: Relative risk (RR) for readmission risk 9 to 0 months before a first-trimester induced abortion was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.73-1.23) compared with the first year after the abortion. This contrasts with a reduced risk of readmission before childbirth (RR, 0.56; 95% Cl, 0.42-0.75) compared with the first year post partum. Proximity to previous psychiatric admission in particular predicted rehospitalization risks in both the abortion and the childbirth group.
   Conclusions: Risk of readmission is similar before and after first-time first-trimester abortion, contrasting with a marked increased in risk of readmission post partum. We speculate that recent psychiatric episodes may influence women's decisions to have an induced abortion; however, this decision does not appear to influence the illness course in women with a history of treated mental disorders.

TI  - "One Problem Became Another": Disclosure of Rape-Related Pregnancy in the Abortion Care Setting
T2  - WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES
AB  - Objective: We sought to explore the experiences of women who disclosed that their pregnancies resulted from rape in the abortion care setting, as well as the experiences of professionals involved in care of women with rape-related pregnancy.
   Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 9 patients who had terminated rape-related pregnancies and 12 professionals working in abortion care or rape crisis advocacy (5 abortion providers, 4 rape crisis center advocates, 2 social workers, and 1 clinic administrator). Transcribed interviews were coded and analyzed for themes related to the experiences of disclosing rape and the consequences of disclosure in the abortion care setting.
   Results: Patients and professionals involved in care of women with rape-related pregnancy described opportunities arising from disclosure, including interpersonal (explaining abortion decision making in the context of assault, belief, and caring by providers), as well as structural opportunities (funding assistance, legal options, and mental health options). Whereas most patients did not choose to pursue all three structural opportunities, both patients and professionals emphasized the importance of offering them. The most important consequence of disclosure for patients was being believed and feeling that providers cared about them.
   Conclusion: Rape-related pregnancy disclosure in the abortion care setting can lead to opportunities for interpersonal support and open options for funding, legal recourse, and mental health care. Those working in abortion care should create environments conducive to disclosure and opportunities for rape survivors to access these additional options if they desire.

TI  - Violence Against North Korean Refugee Women: Doubly Victimized By Repatriation and Premigration Traumatic Experiences
T2  - VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
AB  - This study investigates the influence of traumatic events on the mental health of North Korean refugee women by examining the prevalence and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety in comparison with their male counterparts (women = 496; men = 131). Our results suggest that women are at greater risk of developing mental health problems than men. In particular, symptoms of PTSD and anxiety were higher among women who experienced forced repatriation to North Korea, which is operationalized as a constellation of gendered traumatic incidents such as sexual abuse, rape, witnessing infanticides, and forced abortion. The policy implications of our results and suggestions for future studies are discussed.

TI  - Dimensions of decision difficulty in women's decision-making about abortion: A mixed methods longitudinal study
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Relatively little is known about the ease or difficulty with which women decide to have an abortion, and most research uses single-item measurements. We used a mixed methods approach to combine data from the Dutch Abortion and Mental Health Study (DAMHS, n = 325) with data from a qualitative study about the decision process with a small subsample (n = 69) of the DAMHS study. We used the findings from the qualitative study to develop the Dimensions of Abortion Decision Difficulty [DADD] scale, and tested this scale among a larger sample of women who took part in the second wave of the cohort study (n = 264). Qualitative analyses revealed six dimensions of decision difficulty. The DADD scale was based on these six dimensions. Results from the DADD scale at follow-up reduced these to four dimensions: (1) unrealistic fears about the abortion and fantasies about the pregnancy; (2) decision conflict; (3) negative abortion attitudes; and (4) general indecisiveness. Decision conflict was the only dimension related to previous mental disorders. The findings suggest that the concept of decision difficulty seems multidimensional, rather than unidimensional. On a clinical level, it could be important to separate the more general fears, attitudes, and indecisiveness from strong decision conflict, because the latter might involve pressure of others, lack of decision ownership, and might be related to previous mental health.

TI  - Abortion Counselling in Britain: Understanding the Controversy
T2  - SOCIOLOGY COMPASS
AB  - This article reviews literature from a number of disciplines in order to provide an explanation of the political controversy attached to the provision of abortion counselling. It will show how this is an area of health policy debate in which women's reproductive bodies have become a setting for political struggle. The issue of abortion counselling in Britain has undergone a number of discursive shifts in response to political manoeuvring and changing socio-legal framing of abortion. In particular, the article shows how much of the controversial reframing of abortion counselling was a tactical shift by political actors opposed to abortion per se, and this work is critiqued for not contextualising abortion. The article then focuses on women's abortion experiences and discusses research that shows how women's decision-making processes, and responses to an abortion, are related to gendered socio-cultural contexts: the extent to which women having an abortion feel they have transgressed societal norms and values, for example, is likely to affect their abortion experiences. Finally, it is suggested that providing a non-judgemental context, and challenging negative discourses on abortion, may be the most effective way of minimising the possibility of negative emotions.

TI  - 'Still travelling': Access to abortion post-12 weeks gestation in Ireland
T2  - WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
AB  - This article focuses on access to abortion in Ireland post-12 weeks gestational age. It critically examines abortion access under the legislative sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018, the Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) process, as well as the appeals process in place. We highlight existing ambiguities in diagnosing and certifying cases of risk to health during pregnancy, particularly mental health, as well as the challenges in diagnosing and certifying cases of fatal fetal abnormality (FFA). The article incorporates service users' experiences in obtaining abortion in Ireland post-12 weeks, particularly in cases of FFA, and includes recommendations for policy and legislative change.

TI  - Medico-legal aspects of abortion in Europe
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTRACEPTION AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE
AB  - Objective The practice of abortion in a particular country reflects culture, economic status, religion and the law. Various aspects of abortion in Europe - laws, rates and practices - are presented.
   Results Abortion is completely prohibited in Ireland and Malta. In Poland it is permitted only to save the woman's life or protect her physical health. On the grounds of protecting the woman's mental health it is also permitted in Northern Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. On socioeconomic grounds abortion is permitted in Finland, Great Britain and Hungary. In the other European countries it is permitted on demand. Eastern Europe has the highest abortion rate (Romania 78/1000 women aged 15-44), and Western Europe has the lowest (The Netherlands 6.5/1000); the disparity may be attributable to differences in availability and use of effective contraceptives. Within the first 12 weeks of gestation, vacuum aspiration has replaced dilatation and curettage, as the most commonly used method to perform abortion. More recently, medical abortion (mifepristone with prostaglandins) in early pregnancy has been used in several European countries.
   Conclusions Reduction of the need for induced abortion and prevention of unsafe abortion through the provision of appropriate legislation and good family planning services should be an integral part of health care in every country.

TI  - Sequelae of abortion and relinquishment of child custody among women with major psychiatric disorders
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
AB  - A growing number of women with major psychiatric disorders frequently consider the choice of abortion or relinquishment of the custody of children. Psychological reactions to abortion and relinquishment of custody were assessed and contrasted among 119 hospitalized Nomen of M age 40 yr. and psychiatric patients. An original questionnaire was developed to assess emotional symptoms, psychiatric signs, attitudes, and satisfaction with the decision regarding the loss of a fetus or child. As hypothesized, reported sequelae of relinquishments of custody were rated as significantly more severe than sequelae of abortion. Dissatisfaction with choice, negative attitudes, religious affiliation, and involuntary removal of a child from custody were predictive of distress following abortion or relinquishment. The findings show that increased efforts are needed to help women with psychiatric difficulties cope with reproductive planning and losses.

TI  - Women's experiences of and reactions to antiabortion picketing
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This study examines responses to antiabortion picketing among women who encountered picketers as they entered 1 of 3 abortion clinics to have an abortion. The goals of this study are to describe women's experiences with, emotional reactions to, and attitudes toward antiabortion picketers; examine predictors of women's emotional responses to picketers; and examine the relations among exposure to picketers and emotional responses to picketers and postabortion mental health. Results indicated that most women encountered antiabortion picketers on clinic entry and experienced negative emotions in response. Women were more likely to feel angry than guilty in response to seeing picketers. Reports of positive emotions were rare. Women whose entry was blocked by picketers were more likely to experience both anger and guilt in response to picketers. Women who were personally conflicted about abortion were more likely to experience guilt, but not anger, in response to picketers. Feeling guilty in response to seeing picketers and being high in personal conflict about abortion were significant predictors of depression immediately postabortion. Feeling angry in response to picketers was unrelated to postabortion mental health. In general, women seemed to find encounters with picketers unpleasant and to be negatively affected by them in the short term but not to suffer serious, long-term, negative psychological effects as a result of these encounters.

TI  - "Shouldn't Nobody Make a Woman do What they Don't Want to do with their Body": Black Women's Reactions to the Supreme Court's Overturn of Roe v. Wade
T2  - JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES
AB  - Black women, particularly those with low-income, are projected to be the most negatively impacted group following the Supreme Court's overturn of Roe v Wade. It is expected that the rate of increase in live births, as well as the rate of maternal mortality, will be steepest for Black women due to high rates of unmet needs for contraception, unintended pregnancies, poverty, barriers to legal abortion access, and systemic racism. Previous research has shown that the legalization of abortion in 1973 significantly improved educational and employment outcomes for Black women, in particular. The current study seeks to assess the perceptions of predominantly under-resourced Black women following the overturning of Roe v Wade. Eighteen Black women participated in one of five focus groups during the summer of 2022 and shared their reactions to the Supreme Court ruling. Using grounded theory, researchers generated the following themes: sexism via forced births, economic implications, and dangers of banned abortions. Based on participants' concerns resulting from the Roe v Wade overturn, policy implications are provided for improving the following systems: safety net, child welfare, and infant and perinatal mental health care.

TI  - Is underage abortion associated with adverse outcomes in early adulthood? A longitudinal birth cohort study up to 25 years of age
T2  - HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Is underage abortion associated with adverse socioeconomic and health outcomes in early adulthood when compared with underage delivery?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Underage abortion was not found to be associated with mental health problems in early adulthood, and socioeconomic outcomes were better among those who experienced abortion compared with those who gave birth.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Teenage motherhood has been linked with numerous adverse outcomes in later life, including low educational levels and poor physical and mental health. Whether abortion at a young age predisposes to similar consequences is not clear.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This nationwide, retrospective cohort study from Finland, included all women born in 1987 (n = 29 041) and followed until 2012.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We analysed socioeconomic, psychiatric and risk-taking-related health outcomes up to 25 years of age after underage (< 18 years) abortion (n = 1041, 3.6%) and after childbirth (n = 394, 1.4%). Before and after conception analyses within the study groups were performed to further examine the association between abortion and adverse health outcomes. A group with no pregnancies up to 20 years of age (n = 25 312, 88.0%) served as an external reference group.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We found no significant differences between the underage abortion and the childbirth group regarding risks of psychiatric disorders (adjusted odds ratio 0.96 [0.67-1.40]) or suffering from intentional or unintentional poisoning by medications or drugs (1.06 [0.57-1.98]). Compared with those who gave birth, girls who underwent abortion were less likely to achieve only a low educational level (0.41 [95% confidence interval 0.31-0.54]) or to be welfare-dependent (0.31 [0.22-0.45]), but more likely to suffer from injuries (1.51 [1.09-2.10]). Compared with the external control group, both pregnancy groups were disadvantaged already prior to the pregnancy. Psychiatric disorders and risk-taking-related health outcomes, including injury, were increased in the abortion group and in the childbirth group similarly on both sides of the pregnancy.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The retrospective nature of the study remains a limitation. The identification of study subjects in order to collect additional data was not allowed for ethical reasons. Therefore further confounding factors, such as the intentionality of the pregnancy, could not be checked.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Previous studies have found that abortion is not harmful to mental health in the majority of adult women. Our study adds to the current understanding in suggesting that this is also the case concerning underage girls. Furthermore, women with a history of underage abortion had better socioeconomic outcomes compared with those who gave birth. These findings can be generalized to settings of high-quality social and health-care services, where abortion is accessible and affordable to all citizens. Social and health-care professionals who care for and counsel underage girls facing unplanned pregnancy should acknowledge this information.
   STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was financially supported by the Finnish Cultural Foundation and the Paivikki and Sakari Sohlberg Foundation. The researchers are independent of funders and the funders had no role in the study design, in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data, in the writing of the report or in the decision to submit the article for publication. The authors have no competing interests.

TI  - Access to choice: Examining differences between adolescent and adult abortion fund service recipients
T2  - HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY
AB  - The results of a study examining differences between U.S. adolescent and adult abortion fund service recipients are presented in this paper. Using existing case data from 2010 to 2015 from the National Network of Abortion Funds (N=3,288), a secondary data analysis was conducted to determine whether or not the experiences of adolescent (n=481) and adult abortion patients (n=2,807) who received financial assistance to help pay for an abortion differed. Fisher's exact tests examined differences in dichotomous variables, and regression examined differences in procedural costs, patient resources and expected travel distances to obtain an abortion. Results show that a greater proportion of adolescents in this data set identified as African American, and that adolescents were more likely to report seeking an abortion due to lack of contraception, and rape, while adult patients were more likely to be seeking an abortion due to contraceptive failure and partner violence. Results are discussed using a trauma-informed framework.

TI  - 'I really wanted to abort' Desire for abortion, failed abortion and forced motherhood in South-Western Nigeria
T2  - GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Continued pregnancy after an abortion attempt is a likely outcome in countries where unsafe abortions prevail. Yet there is a paucity of literature on the consequences and implications of failed abortions. This study explored young women's abortion decision-making, their experiences of failed abortion and its consequences in South-Western Nigeria. It presents findings from semi-structured interviews conducted with 14 women who had become unintentionally pregnant as unmarried teenagers, desired abortions, yet became mothers. Whilst the fear of the stigma associated with young unmarried motherhood gave rise to participants' desire for abortion, restrictive abortion laws influenced their experiences and abortion decision-making. Participants who attempted an abortion failed and were forced to carry their unwanted pregnancies to term. They then experienced continued discrimination, forced motherhood, and a rejection of maternalism. Their experiences are analysed as responses to the complex interplay between social norms, abortion restrictions, stigma and forced motherhood. The paper makes a case for improving women's reproductive autonomy in decision-making, - highlighting the social and mental health consequences of restricted access to abortion, and reinforce the importance of taking a holistic approach to addressing the sexual health of young women, by focusing not only on physical health but also on ensuring wellbeing.

TI  - Looking Back, Looking Forward: Examining the Processing of Abortion Experiences Using Public Abortion Narratives
T2  - AFFILIA-FEMINIST INQUIRY IN SOCIAL WORK
AB  - Limited research has utilized public abortion narratives to understand how individuals process through their abortion experiences. To address this gap in the literature, this study used thematic analysis to consider the public abortion stories of 39 participants from the Tennessee Stories Project, focusing on how individuals process through these experiences and the context of the abortion experience in a person's life course. Participants were primarily those who were abortion patients; however, abortion providers and supporters including partners or spouses, family members, and friends of those who received abortion care were also represented. Data analysis indicated that abortion seekers engage in introspection, involving political and religious/spiritual considerations; report specific feelings about their abortion experience, including having no regrets and feeling gratitude; process emotions related to the abortion experience by normalizing emotional responses and using mementos; and position their abortion in the context of their life, both in terms of their family and career opportunities and personal development. These findings provide valuable insight into how individuals process through the abortion experience, before, during, and after the abortion procedure, and suggest possible directions for service providers, advocates, and policy makers in order to better support abortion patients, providers, and family members.

TI  - The spread of 'Post Abortion Syndrome' as social diagnosis
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - This paper examines the content of Post Abortion Syndrome (PAS) claims, the social actors involved and how this social diagnosis bypassed professional dissent and diffused into public policy in the United States. Previous works on the spread of PAS focus on almost exclusively on anti-abortion think tanks and policymakers. Missing from these analyses, however, is an emphasis on the grassroots-level actions undertaken by evangelical crisis pregnancy center (CPC) activists in introducing and circulating PAS claims. The CPC movement introduced PAS claims and provided the fodder for anti-abortion think tanks to construct evidence of pro-life claims. Despite dissent from health professionals and academic researchers, CPC PAS claims successfully diffused into federal and state abortion policy. I draw upon Brown et al.'s social diagnosis framework and Armstrong's five-stage model of diagnosis development to frame this account. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Questionnaires returned by 1428 women with 2961 pregnancies showed that a higher number of losses, particularly abortions, correlates both with poor health and the need to obtain professional help in dealing with the loss(es).  Partner support appears to be one of the most important factors in maintaining a pregnancy.

TI  - Abortion law across Australia - A review of nine jurisdictions
T2  - AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY
AB  - This article reviews the current legal status of abortion in Australia and its implications. Australian abortion law has been a matter for the states since before Federation. In the years since Federation there have been significant reforms and changes in the abortion laws of some jurisdictions, although not all. Across Australia there are now nine sets of laws, state and Commonwealth, concerned with abortion. The test of a lawful abortion varies greatly across jurisdictions. In a number of states and territories, it is necessary to establish a serious risk to the physical or mental health of the woman if the pregnancy was to continue. In some cases, the certification of two doctors is required, particularly for abortions at later gestations. There are also physical restrictions on access, such as in South Australia and the Northern Territory where abortion must take place in a hospital. Only in the ACT has abortion been removed from the criminal law altogether. Variations in the law and restrictions arising from these are not consistent with the aims and provision of the universal, accessible health care system aspired to in Australia. There is an urgent need for overall reform and the introduction of uniformity to Australia's abortion laws, including removal of abortion from the criminal law.

TI  - Structural gender inequalities and symptoms of postpartum depression in 40 countries
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Background: The role of structural gender inequality in macro-level differences in women's perinatal mental health remains largely unexplored. This short communication explores structural gender inequalities and their potential as a macro-level, upstream social determinant of postpartum depression (PPD).
   Methods: We compiled meta-analytically derived national-level prevalence estimates of PPD symptoms - based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale - with economic (e.g., income inequality), health (e.g., infant mortality rate), sociodemographic (e.g., urban population), and structural gender inequality variables (e.g., abortion policies) for 40 countries. Meta-regression techniques and traditional p-value based stepwise procedures, complemented with a Bayesian model averaging approach, were used for a robust selection of variables associated with national-level PPD symptom prevalence.
   Results: Income inequality (p = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.07) and abortion policies (beta = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.00 to 0.03) were the only variables selected in the final, adjusted model, accounting for 60.7% of cross-national variations in PPD symptoms.
   Limitations: Study quality of primary studies was not assessed and some national-level meta-analytical estimates were based on few primary studies. A fifth of world countries and territories could be included, with high-income regions overrepresented. High rate of missing national-level data for potential predictors of PPD. Cross-sectional analyses precludes causal inferences.
   Conclusions: Abortion policies are a significant macro-level social determinant of PPD, and its liberalization might be associated with women's mental health at a population level. Our findings should be a relevant argument for clinicians to advocate for changing discriminatory social norms against women.

TI  - The Mental and Physical Health Impacts of Overturning Roe v Wade COMMENT
T2  - JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
AB  - The overturning of Roe v Wade has resulted in the loss of reproductive rights for millions of women in the United States. It has also put these women at risk of severe mental and physical health consequences. When legal abortions are restricted, there is a rise in illegal abortion with the risk of hemorrhage, infection, infertility, and death. There are many more risks of carrying a pregnancy to term than health or psychological risks of a legal abortion. Women who have a miscarriage risk having to prove they did not abort. In cases of medical emergencies, doctors may be restricted from performing life-saving abortions for fear of penalties. Women or children who have been victims of rape or incest will have to either have an illegal abortion or carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. In states that allow an abortion in cases of severe risk to a mother's health, panels of internists and psychiatrist may, again, be charged with deciding whether her risks are valid. Women's physical and mental health will suffer.

TI  - Posttraumatic stress among women after induced abortion: a Swedish multi-centre cohort study
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background: Induced abortion is a common medical intervention. Whether psychological sequelae might follow induced abortion has long been a subject of concern among researchers and little is known about the relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and induced abortion. Thus, the aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of PTSD and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) before and at three and six months after induced abortion, and to describe the characteristics of the women who developed PTSD or PTSS after the abortion.
   Methods: This multi-centre cohort study included six departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Sweden. The study included 1457 women who requested an induced abortion, among whom 742 women responded at the three-month follow-up and 641 women at the six-month follow-up. The Screen Questionnaire-Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (SQ-PTSD) was used for research diagnoses of PTSD and PTSS, and anxiety and depressive symptoms were evaluated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Measurements were made at the first visit and at three and six months after the abortion. The 95% confidence intervals for the prevalence of lifetime or ongoing PTSD and PTSS were calculated using the normal approximation. The chi-square test and the Student's t-test were used to compare data between groups.
   Results: The prevalence of ongoing PTSD and PTSS before the abortion was 4.3% and 23.5%, respectively, concomitant with high levels of anxiety and depression. At three months the corresponding rates were 2.0% and 4.6%, at six months 1.9% and 6.1%, respectively. Dropouts had higher rates of PTSD and PTSS. Fifty-one women developed PTSD or PTSS during the observation period. They were young, less well educated, needed counselling, and had high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. During the observation period 57 women had trauma experiences, among whom 11 developed PTSD or PTSS and reported a traumatic experience in relation to the abortion.
   Conclusion: Few women developed PTSD or PTSS after the abortion. The majority did so because of trauma experiences unrelated to the induced abortion. Concomitant symptoms of depression and anxiety call for clinical alertness and support.

TI  - Prenatal management of anencephaly
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
AB  - About a third of anencephalic fetuses are born alive, but they are not conscious or viable, and soon die. This neural tube defect can be limited by dietary consumption of foliates, and detected prenatally by ultrasound and other means. Many laws permit abortion, on this indication or on the effects of pregnancy and prospects of delivery on a woman's physical or mental health. However, abortion is limited under some legal systems, particularly in South America. To avoid criminal liability, physicians will not terminate pregnancies, by induced birth or abortion, without prior judicial approval. Argentinian courts have developed means to resolve these cases, but responses of Brazilian courts are less clear. Ethical concerns relate to late-term abortion, meaning after the point of fetal viability, but since anencephalic fetuses are nonviable, many ethical concerns are overcome. Professional guidance is provided by several professional and institutional codes on management of anencephalic pregnancies. (c) 2008 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

TI  - Induced Abortion and Relevant Factors among Women Seeking Abortion in Nanjing, China
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC AND OBSTETRIC INVESTIGATION
AB  - Aims: This study aimed to determine the sociological characteristics of abortion seekers according to marital status and previous induced abortions in a major regional hospital in Nanjing, China. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire in women seeking abortion at Nanjing Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital in China in 2003. Results: The average age of the participants was 26.0 +/- 4.5 years. Of the 462 abortion seekers, 95.9% had one previous induced abortion. The majority (49.6%) of the ever-married women were in the age group of 25-29 while the majority (76.9%) of the unmarried women were aged 20-24 years. Unprotected intercourse (53.6%) and contraception failure (43.9%) were the primary reasons given for the current induced abortion for ever-married women. Unmarried women terminated their current pregnancies mainly because they did not want children (62.1%). Of the 182 unmarried subjects, 86.8% had psychological problems in their premarital pregnancy. Conclusions: Education and communication about sexual morality, contraception and reproductive health, as well as post-abortion counseling and services, especially for young women, are needed to reduce the rate of induced abortions.

TI  - INDUCED ABORTION: WOMEN'S SPEECH ON THEIR FAMILY RELATIONS
T2  - TEXTO & CONTEXTO ENFERMAGEM
AB  - Induced Abortion and domestic violence against women are considered to be public health issues for the physical and mental health consequences they invoke. The objective of this study was to analyze the speech of women who experienced abortion concerning their family relationships. The subjects of the research were 17 women hospitalized in a public maternity in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, for induced abortion. The data was collected between July and September 2008 through semi-structured interviews, organized from the Collective Speech of the Subject. The central ideas that emerged from their speeches show that the decision to abort was derived from the women's history of violence lived with their partners and relatives, besides the abandonment resulting from the discovery of their pregnancy. Nursing needs to understand the social context in which women who abort are inserted so that practices can be restructured.

TI  - Reflections of stress in US abortion narratives
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK
AB  - A trauma-informed, thematic analysis that identified stress-related themes evident in 39 personal abortion narratives from the Tennessee Stories Project in the United States is presented in this paper. Using the Braun and Clarke model of thematic analysis, guided by the trauma-informed social work framework, researchers examined these narratives to identify stress related themes. Findings An overall theme of stress and traumatic stress was found to be present throughout the abortion narratives. These themes were categorized into subthemes, including: (a) existing life stressors preceding the abortion experience, (b) stressors while trying to access abortion services, (c) stressors while obtaining abortion services, and (d) stressors arising after the procedure. Applications These results suggest that stress and traumatic stress were reflected in these abortion narratives throughout the abortion seeking experience. This finding supports the need for social work practice responses that are designed to address and eliminate stress during the process of seeking and obtaining an abortion in the United States. A trauma-informed framework is recommended for guiding social work education about abortion, social worker interactions with clients who are seeking abortions, and the development of abortion policy in the United States in order to better align the abortion seeking experience with the principles of trauma-informed care.

TI  - Miscarriage and Abortion Among Women Attending Harm Reduction Services in Philadelphia: Correlations With Individual, Interpersonal, and Structural Factors
T2  - SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE
AB  - Background: Reproductive health research among women who use drugs has focused on pregnancy prevention and perinatal/neonatal outcomes, but there have been few investigations of miscarriage and abortion, including prevalence and associated factors. Methods: Using cross-sectional data from a sample of non-pregnant women receiving harm reduction services in Philadelphia in 2016-2017 we examined lifetime miscarriage and abortion (n = 187). Separately for both outcomes, we used modified Poisson regression to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations with each correlate. We also explored correlates of reporting both miscarriage and abortion. Results: Approximately 47% experienced miscarriage, 42% experienced abortion, and 18% experienced both. Miscarriage correlates included: prescription opioid misuse (e.g., OxyContin PR 1.82, 95% CI 1.23, 2.69); 40% increase in prevalence associated with housing instability, 50% increase with survival sex, and two-fold increase with arrest. Abortion correlates included: mental health (e.g., depression PR 2.09, 95% CI 1.18, 3.71), stimulant use (e.g., methamphetamine PR 1.83, 95% CI 1.22, 2.74), and drug injection (PR 1.76, 95% CI 1.03, 3.02); partner controlling access to people/possessions, physical and emotional violence; and a two-fold increase associated with survival sex and arrest. Experiencing both reproductive outcomes was correlated with mental health, opioid and simulant use, housing instability, survival sex, and arrest. Conclusion: Miscarriage and abortion was common among women with history of drug misuse suggesting a need for expanded access to family planning, medication-assisted therapy, and social support services, and for the integration of these with substance use services. Future research in longitudinal data is needed.

TI  - Does abortion reduce self-esteem and life satisfaction?
T2  - QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose This study aims to assess the effects of obtaining an abortion versus being denied an abortion on self-esteem and life satisfaction.
   Methods We present the first 2.5 years of a 5-year longitudinal telephone-interview study that follows 956 women who sought an abortion from 30 facilities across the USA. We examine the self-esteem and life satisfaction trajectories of women who sought and received abortions just under the facility's gestational age limit, of women who sought and received abortions in their first trimester of pregnancy, and of women who sought abortions just beyond the facility gestational limit and were denied an abortion. We use adjusted mixed effects linear regression analyses to assess whether the trajectories of women who sought and obtained an abortion differ from those who were denied one.
   Results Women denied an abortion initially reported lower self-esteem and life satisfaction than women who sought and obtained an abortion. For all study groups, except those who obtained first trimester abortions, self-esteem and life satisfaction improved over time. The initially lower levels of self-esteem and life satisfaction among women denied an abortion improved more rapidly reaching similar levels as those obtaining abortions at 6 months to one year after abortion seeking. For women obtaining first trimester abortions, initially higher levels of life satisfaction remained steady over time.
   Conclusions There is no evidence that abortion harms women's self-esteem or life satisfaction in the short term.

TI  - Diagnostic categorization of post-abortion syndrome
T2  - ACTAS ESPANOLAS DE PSIQUIATRIA
AB  - Some psychopathological characteristics are frequently observed in women who have voluntarily aborted. However, some resistance currently remains to their recognition as a differentiated nosological category, known as Post-Abortion Syndrome (PAS). We tried to assign a diagnostic category to women with PAS by determining the extent by which they fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of international classifications. Criteria for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) were met in the ten PAS cases studied. In addition, patients also showed other non-specific symptoms such as repeated and persistent dreams and nightmares related with the abortion, intense feelings of guilt and the "need to repair". PAS should be considered as an additional type of PTSD. It also has some specific characteristics that could help to understand the patient's life experience and to establish a psychotherapeutic intervention.

TI  - "We Are the Visible Proof": Legitimizing Abortion Regret Misinformation through Activists' Experiential Knowledge
T2  - LAW & POLICY
AB  - Since 2010, many abortion policies emerging at the state level have been designed around the idea of abortion regret, a scientifically discredited assertion that abortion causes long-term health problems for women. Studies have examined the legal significance of regret claims in case law as well as the role scientific misinformation and uncertainty play in the policy process. However, scholars have given less attention to the intersection between abortion regret experiences and misinformation. We address this gap in the literature by examining how antiabortion activists' experiential knowledge continues to reinforce and legitimize misinformation contained in state policies. We explore the process of substantiating abortion regret misinformation by attaching it to activists' experiential expertise. Based on twenty-three interviews with antiabortion activists, we argue that misinformation receives validation through the certainty of experiential knowledge, which activists mobilize around and use as a source of evidence in the policy process.

AB  - Objective. To propose recommendations for women's counseling in abortion request and the psychological experience of orthogenic teams.
   Materials and methods. Bibliographic search in the Medline database, PubMed, Cochrane Database Library, EM Premium bases, ENT Unistra and Cairn from 1990 to 2016.
   Results. During the pre-abortion consultations, it is recommended to respect the choice of the woman on to see or not the ultrasound images (grade C) and determine with her the time it needs to perform abortion (professional agreement). Women's satisfaction seems greater when they have the possibility to choose the abortion method (grade B). It is therefore important that both methods are available to all gestational ages (professional agreement). There is no relationship between an increase in psychiatric disorders and induced abortion (NP2). Meetings for professionals are useful and should, to the extent possible, be established (professional agreement).
   Conclusion. Improving psychological support for women involve listening them and respect their choice. This also involves thinking as a team. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The frequency of telemedicine encounters has increased dramatically in recent years. This review summarizes the literature regarding the safety and quality of telemedicine for pregnancy-related ser-vices, including prenatal care, postpartum care, diabetes mellitus management, medication abortion, lactation support, hypertension management, genetic counseling, ultrasound examination, contra-ception, and mental health services. For many of these, telemedicine has several potential or proven benefits, including expanded patient access, improved patient satisfaction, decreased disparities in care delivery, and health outcomes at least comparable to those of traditional in-person encounters. Considering these benefits, it is suggested that payers should reimburse providers at least as much for telemedicine as for in-person services. Areas for future research are considered.

TI  - Predictors of personal growth in induced abortion
T2  - PSICOTHEMA
AB  - Background: Knowledge about the psychological experience in induced abortion remains limited. Studies have been biased towards negative consequences. Method: A descriptive and prospective study was conducted. Participants were 338 adult women who came to have an induced abortion in authorized centers of Las Palmas (Spain). Results: A large proportion of women reflected moderate to very high personal growth at all measurement times (from 64.79% to 76.36%), with statistically significant increases. The perception of social support explained most of the variance in the cross-sectional prediction of personal growth, both at the time of the abortion and in the follow-up one month later. The variables that predicted growth longitudinally were: greater perception of the abortion as a turning point in their lives, lower level of academic education, greater frequency of thoughts about abortion one month later, lower frequency of thoughts about abortion six months later, and greater perceived social support one month later. Conclusions: The perception of personal growth is part of the psychological experience of abortion. This finding invites us to broaden the traditional focus on the psychological effects of induced abortion, to also include the positive outcomes.

TI  - The Characteristics and Severity of Psychological Distress After Abortion Among University Students
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES & RESEARCH
AB  - Controversy over abortion inhibits recognition and treatment for women who experience psychological distress after abortion (PAD). This study identified the characteristics, severity, and treatment preferences of university students who experienced PAD. Of 151 females, 89 experienced an abortion. Psychological outcomes were compared among those who preferred or did not prefer psychological services after abortion to those who were never pregnant. All who had abortions reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and grief lasting on average 3 years. Yet, those who preferred services experienced heightened psychological trauma indicative of partial or full PTSD (Impact of Event Scale, M = 26.86 versus 16.84, p < .05), perinatal grief (Perinatal Grief Scale, M 62.54 versus 50.89, p < 0.05), dysthymia (BDI M = 11.01 versus 9.28, p < 0.05), (M = 41.86 versus 39.36, p < 0.05), and co-existing mental health problems. PAD appeared multi-factorial, associated with the abortion and overall emotional health. Thus, psychological interventions for PAD need to be developed as a public health priority.

TI  - Induced Abortion and Life Satisfaction in Germany: The Role of Selection Processes and Short-Term Effects
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE
AB  - Unintended pregnancies resulting in induced abortion are occasionally associated with poor psychological well-being. In the literature, this is attributed to either (1) the consequences of abortion, (2) the consequences of unintended pregnancy, or (3) specific selection processes. This longitudinal study addresses these explanations based on data from the German family panel "pairfam" (n = 3,604 women). It compares changes in life satisfaction among different groups of women: Those who had an abortion, those who had a live birth, and those who were not pregnant. A matching procedure ensures the comparability of the groups. The results show that women reported temporarily lower life satisfaction immediately after abortion than similar women following live birth or in absence of pregnancy, while no significant group differences were found in the long run. However, abortion is preceded by significantly lower pre-event life satisfaction than live birth or absence of pregnancy. Persistent poor well-being should therefore primarily be considered a selection criterion for abortions resulting from unintended pregnancies rather than as their consequence.

TI  - Knowledge, Moral Attitude, and Practice of Nursing Students Toward Abortion
T2  - INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING
AB  - In 2021, Thailand decriminalized abortions to allow for legal abortions on request up to 12 weeks' gestation and conditionally up to 20 weeks' gestation, or in the case of sexual assault, maternal mental or physical harm, or fetal abnormality. We intend to say that healthcare practitioners' positive attitudes toward abortion will destigmatize abortion for both themselves and their patients. We explored the knowledge, attitudes, and intended practices of nursing students toward safe abortion practices in light of the recent law reform. This was a cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 4 parts: a demographic information questionnaire; and measures to assess their knowledge, moral attitudes, and intended practice regarding safe abortion care. Questionnaires were sent to 206 nursing students who had completed the Midwifery and Maternal-Newborn Nursing rotation in Bangkok, Thailand. The survey response rate was 90.8%. Mean (standard deviation) knowledge score was 6.72 (1.86) out of 10. Buddhist students were more likely to have a positive attitude toward abortions. Most students intended to practice safe abortions in pregnancies that affect maternal physical or mental health, or in pregnancies that resulted from unlawful sexual contact. Students were more ambivalent toward abortion practices for socioeconomic reasons. Better knowledge of abortion legislation was associated with a more positive attitude toward abortions and safe abortion practice intention. Approximately 1 year after the abortion law reform in Thailand, nursing students had incomplete knowledge of the amendment. Most students were inclined to provide abortion care services for certain conditions.

TI  - Physical and Mental Health Status of Women whose Spouses Inject Drugs - A Cross-Sectional, Multisite Study
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Substance use disorder impacts the lives of significant others, more especially the wives of individuals using substances. However, the physical and mental health issues among wives of people who inject drugs (PWID) are less studied. The current cross-sectional, multisite study assessed the physical and mental health of wives of 433 PWID across six sites in Delhi. The mean age of the participants was 32.7 years (standard deviation: 9.7). More than 50% of the participants reported menstrual problems, most commonly dysmenorrhea. Around 55.9% had adverse pregnancy outcomes (abortion, miscarriage, or stillbirth). Around one out of four participants reported at least one specific sexually transmitted infection symptom. Around 11% were diagnosed with tuberculosis and 35% with a major medical illness in their lifetime. More than 90% of the participants had depressive and anxiety symptoms. The study showed that there is a huge burden of physical and mental health issues among the wives of PWID.

TI  - The mind is a brittle object: The abortion law and therapeutic legitimation
T2  - HISTORY OF THE HUMAN SCIENCES
AB  - This article takes a historical look at abortion in Norway, especially the parliamentary debates and the legislation on selective abortion. By using metaphor theory and discourse analysis we disclose that mental health issues came into practice as a legitimate cause for selective abortion for women in Norway from the 1960s and recur in more recent debates about important amendments in 1996 and 2003. In order to abort, women must simultaneously adopt a psychological means of self-representation. The history of the discourse on selective abortion in Norway thus illustrates the often ambiguous relationship between reproductive policy and 'psy'. The analysis also shows that a therapeutic discourse today creates a framework of meaning for all political parties in Norway in the questions regarding abortion, including the Christian Democratic Party traditionally committed to religious motifs. This particular part of the history of abortion in Norway suggests that the psy-sciences and a therapeutic outlook on the self and society came into being in Norway from the 1960s, marking a defining moral shift from the previous religious and moral reasoning to a therapeutic ethos.

TI  - Existential experiences and needs related to induced abortion in a group of Swedish women: a quantitative investigation
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Objective: To investigate the prevalence of existential experiences and needs among women who have requested an induced abortion. Methods: A questionnaire was used to collect information from 499 women who had requested an induced abortion. A principle component analysis resulted in three components of existential experiences and needs: existential thoughts, existential practices, and humanisation of the foetus. These components were analysed in relation to background data and other data from the questionnaire. Results: Existential experiences and needs were common. For 61% of women existential thoughts about life and death, meaning and morality were related to the abortion experience. Almost 50% of women reported a need for special acts in relation to the abortion; 67% of women thought of the pregnancy in terms of a child. A higher presence of existential components correlated to difficulty in making the abortion decision and poor psychological wellbeing after the abortion. Conclusion: Women's experiences of abortion can include existential thoughts about life, death, meaning and morality, feelings of attachment to the foetus, and the need for symbolic expression. This presents a challenge for abortion personnel, as the situation involves complex aspects over and above medical procedures and routines.

TI  - Distance Traveled to Obtain Clinical Abortion Care in the United States and Reasons for Clinic Choice
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: Greater distance to abortion facilities is associated with greater out-of-pocket costs, emergency room follow-up care, negative mental health, and delayed care among U.S. abortion patients. However, the distance U.S. abortion patients travel has not been reported since 2008, and no study has examined reasons abortion patients choose the particular facility where they obtain their abortion. Methods: We analyzed data from the 2014 Abortion Patient Survey and Abortion Provider Census to report abortion patients' one-way travel from their resident zip code to their abortion clinic, whether they went to the closest clinic, and reasons for facility choice. We report unadjusted and adjusted associations of patients' characteristics with travel distance and differences in average travel distance by abortion patients' reported reasons for choosing their facility. Results: In 2014, 65% of abortion patients traveled less than 25 miles one-way, 17% traveled 25-49 miles, and 18% traveled more than 50 miles. Abortion patients who were white, college-educated, U.S.-born, >= 12 weeks pregnant, and lived outside metropolitan areas were more likely to travel farther. Nearly half of abortion patients went to their nearest provider and 32% chose their facility because it was the closest. Conclusion: These results indicate that travel distance is an important determinant of abortion care access in the United States. Nearly, one-fifth of U.S. abortion patients traveled more than 50 miles one-way and the most common reason reported for clinic choice was that it was the closest.

TI  - Unsafe abortion and postabortion care - an overview
T2  - ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Forty per cent of the world's women are living in countries with restrictive abortion laws, which prohibit abortion or only allow abortion to protect a woman's life or her physical or mental health. In countries where abortion is restricted, women have to resort to clandestine interventions to have an unwanted pregnancy terminated. As a consequence, high rates of unsafe abortion are seen, such as in Sub-Saharan Africa where unsafe abortion occurs at rates of 18-39 per 1 000 women. The circumstances under which women obtain unsafe abortion vary and depend on traditional methods known and types of providers present. Health professionals are prone to use instrumental procedures to induce the abortion, whereas traditional providers often make a brew of herbs to be drunk in one or more doses. In countries with restrictive abortion laws, high rates of maternal death must be expected, and globally an estimated 66 500 women die every year as a result of unsafe abortions. In addition, a far larger number of women experience short- and long-term health consequences. To address the harmful health consequences of unsafe abortion, a postabortion care model has been developed and implemented with success in many countries where women do not have legal access to abortion. Postabortion care focuses on treatment of incomplete abortion and provision of postabortion contraceptive services. To enhance women's access to postabortion care, focus is increasingly being placed on upgrading midlevel providers to provide emergency treatment as well as implementing misoprostol as a treatment strategy for complications after unsafe abortion.

TI  - Psychological ill-being experienced by first-time mothers and their partners in pregnancy after abortion: a cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
AB  - The psychological effects of abortion have been much discussed lately, with recently published studies indicating that induced abortion (IA) may, contrary to the general consensus, be contributing to psychological symptoms post-abortion. Using a cohort of first-time mothers, we assessed the likelihood of them experiencing psychological ill-being at the midpoint of their pregnancy, depending on their IA history. We also examined the psychological symptoms of their partners, the hypothesis being that ill-being in IA-experienced mothers might reflect onto their partners. Altogether 680 future first-time mothers (9.8% of whom had an IA history) and their partners were selected. Most mothers attended their 16 check-ups at maternity health clinics (MHC), where the family's physical and emotional well-being were checked. Several internationally validated questionnaires, which gauged psychological ill-being, were filled in at the 20th week of pregnancy. There were no significant differences between the study and the control group in terms of psychological ill-being during the pregnancy. The contribution of prior IA to psychological ill-being during the next pregnancy seems to be minimal. The availability of IA procedures, intensive MHC services in Finland, as well as this society's neutral attitude towards IA, may be among the reasons why the results are so positive for mothers who have previously undergone one or more IAs.

TI  - Eliminating the high abortion related complications and deaths in Cameroon: the restrictive legal atmosphere on abortions is no acceptable excuse
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background: The abortion law in Cameroon is highly restrictive. The law permits induced abortions only when the woman's life is at risk, to preserve her physical and mental health, and on grounds of rape or incest. Unsafe abortions remain rampant with however rare reported cases of persecution, even when these abortions are proven to have been carried out illegally.
   Discussion: Available public health interventions are cheap and feasible (Misoprostol and Manual Vacuum Aspiration in post abortion care, modern contraception, post-abortion counseling),and must be implemented to reduce unacceptably high maternal mortality rates in the country which still stand at as high as 596/100.000. Changes in the legal status of abortions might take a long time to come by. Albeit, advocacy efforts must be reinforced to render the law more liberal to permit women to seek safe abortion services. The frequency of abortions, generally clandestine, in this restrictive legal atmosphere has adverse economic, health and social justice implications.
   Conclusion: We argue that a non-optimal or restrictive legal atmosphere is not an acceptable excuse to justify these high maternal deaths resulting from unsafe abortions, especially in Cameroon where unsafe abortions remain rampant. Implementing currently available, cheap and effective evidence based practice guidelines are possible in the country. Expansion and use of Manual Vacuum Aspiration kits in health care facilities, post-abortion misoprostol and carefully considering the content of post abortion counseling packages deserve keen attention. More large scale qualitative and quantitative studies nationwide to identify and act on context specific barriers to contraception use and abortion related stigma are urgently needed.

TI  - Reproductive Rights and Informed Consent: Toward a More Inclusive Discourse
T2  - ANALYSES OF SOCIAL ISSUES AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - In the past 2 years, a record number of abortion restrictions have been proposed and enacted in the United States. Such restrictions include parental notification and consent laws, mandatory waiting periods, preabortion counseling, sonogram requirements, and restrictions on late-term abortions. These restrictions are often positioned in the language of informed consent with legislators and policymakers asserting that women regret abortions, are physically and psychologically harmed by them, and are advantaged by continuing their pregnancies to term. In this paper, I position these restrictions, as well as ideas about parenting, within a framework of pronatalism, an ideology that venerates parenting as normative and desirable, and generally disparages other choices surrounding reproductive choices, particularly for women. Research about the incidence and impact of abortion on women's lives, as well as the physiological, psychological, financial, and other effects of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting on adults' well-being, is presented. Myths pertaining to abortion and parenting are explored. Recommendations for psychologists conclude the article.

TI  - Receiving versus being denied an abortion and subsequent drug use
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE
AB  - Background: Some research finds that women receiving abortions are at increased risk of subsequent drug use and drug use disorders. This literature is rife with methodological problems, particularly inappropriate comparison groups.
   Methods: This study used data from the Turnaway Study, a prospective, longitudinal study of women who sought abortions at 30 sites across the U.S. Participants included women presenting just prior to an abortion facility's gestational age limit who received abortions (Near Limit Abortion Group, n=452), just beyond the gestational limit who were denied abortions (Turnaways, n=231), and who received first trimester abortions (First Trimester Abortion Group, n=273). This study examined the relationship between receiving versus being denied an abortion and subsequent drug use over two years. Trajectories of drug use were compared using multivariate mixed effects regression.
   Results: Any drug use, frequency of drug use, and marijuana use did not change over time among women in any group. There were no differential changes over time in any drug use, frequency of drug use, or marijuana use between groups. However, Turnaways who ultimately gave birth increased use of drugs other than marijuana compared to women in the Near Limit Abortion Group (p = .041), who did not increase use.
   Conclusion: Women receiving abortions did not increase drug use over two years or have higher levels of drug use than women denied abortions. Assertions that abortion leads women to use drugs to cope with the stress of abortion are not supported. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Aim: This paper intends to compare quality of life (QoL) and mental health among pregnant women with and without previous pregnancy loss. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 409 women between the 16th and 30th weeks of gestation in health centers in Ahvaz, Iran, including 145 women with prior pregnancy loss (group 1) and 264 women without such history (group 2). Data were collected using the QoL Short Form-36 questionnaire, the Mental Health Questionnaire 25 and a questionnaire for assessing sociodemographic variables. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22. Resultswere analyzed using the.2-test, the Student's t-test and logistic regression. P < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant. Results: There was a significant difference between the two groups in respect to QoL and mental health. Women with previous pregnancy loss had lower scores in total and in all subscales of the QoL Short Form-36 (P < 0.001) and higher scores in total and in six out of the nine subscales of the Mental Health Questionnaire 25 compared to women without these histories. Conclusion: Women with history of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth seem to have poorer QoL and mental health during their subsequent pregnancy than those without such experience.

TI  - Mental health of adolescents associated with sexual and reproductive outcomes: a systematic review
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB  - Objective To systematically review the literature on the mental health of adolescents associated with sexual and reproductive outcomes, and compare the mental health outcomes with that of other age groups.
   Methods We searched seven databases for relevant peer-reviewed articles published between 1 January 2010 and 25 April 2019. Our inclusion criteria required that the study included age-disaggregated data on adolescents, and focused and assessed mental health outcomes associated with pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. We extracted data on the specific health event, the mental health outcome and the method of measuring this, and comparisons with other age groups.
   Findings After initially screening 10 818 articles by title and abstract, we included 96 articles in our review. We observed that a wide-ranging prevalence of mental ill-health has been reported for adolescents. However, most studies of mental health during pregnancy did not identify an increased risk of depression or other mental disorders among adolescents compared with other age groups. In contrast, the majority of studies conducted during the postpartum period identified an increased risk of depression in adolescents compared with other age groups. Three studies reported on mental health outcomes following abortion, with varying results. We found no studies of the effect of sexually transmitted infections on mental health among adolescents.
   Conclusion We recommend that sexual and reproductive health services should be accessible to adolescents to address their needs and help to prevent any adverse mental health outcomes.

TI  - Acute and post-traumatic stress disorder after spontaneous abortion
T2  - AMERICAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
AB  - When a spontaneous abortion is followed by complicated bereavement, the primary care physician may not consider the diagnosis of acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. The major difference between these two conditions is that, in acute stress disorder, symptoms such as dissociation, reliving the trauma, avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and increased arousal are present for at least two days but not longer than four weeks. When the symptoms persist beyond four weeks, the patient may have post-traumatic stress disorder. The symptoms of distress response after spontaneous abortion include psychologic, physical, cognitive and behavioral effects; however, patients with distress response after spontaneous abortion often do not meet the criteria for acute or post-traumatic: stress disorder. After spontaneous abortion, as many as 10 percent of women may have acute stress disorder and up to 1 percent may have post-traumatic stress disorder. Critical incident stress debriefing, which may be administered by trained family physicians or mental health practitioners, may help patients who are having a stress disorder after a spontaneous abortion.

TI  - Perceived abortion stigma and psychological well-being over five years after receiving or being denied an abortion
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Objective
   To prospectively assess perceptions of abortion stigma after receiving or being denied an abortion over 5 years, the factors associated with perceived abortion stigma, and the effects of perceived abortion stigma on psychological well-being.
   Methods
   We recruited people seeking abortion from 30 facilities across the US, and interviewed them by phone one week post-abortion seeking, then semiannually for 5 years. We used adjusted mixed effects regression analyses to examine the abortion stigma trajectories of those who obtained an abortion near a facility's gestational age limit (Near-limits) compared to those denied an abortion because they were just over the limit and carried their pregnancies to term (Turnaway- births).
   Results
   Of the 956 people recruited, we removed 28 due to ineligibility or missing data, leaving a final sample of 928. In unadjusted analyses, at one-week post-abortion seeking, over half of those seeking abortion perceived that if others knew they had sought an abortion, they would be looked down upon at least "a little bit" by people close to them (60%) or by people in their community (56%). In longitudinal adjusted analyses, people denied an abortion and who carried their pregnancies to term (Turnaway-birth group) reported significantly lower baseline perceived abortion stigma from people close to them (-0.38; 95% CI, -0.59, -0.16) and from people in their community (0.30; 95% CI, -0.52, -0.08), than Near-limits, differences that remained statistically significant for 1.5 years. Overall perceived abortion stigma declined significantly (p <.001) for both study groups. High perceived abortion stigma at baseline was associated with higher odds of experiencing psychological distress years later (adjusted Odds Ratio, 3.98; 95% CI, 1.39, 11.37).
   Conclusions
   Most people considering abortion perceive some abortion stigma, which is associated with psychological distress years later.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE FOR THE POOR AND UNDERSERVED
AB  - Rising fertility rates among the severely and persistently mentally ill require a better understanding of the family planning needs of this population. In the present study, 82 women hospitalized for major psychiatric disorders were divided into three groups: abortion (n = 22), relinquishment (n = 28), and no children (n = 32). Statistical analyses of demographic, diagnostic, and birth control data showed that those who aborted or relinquished custody of their children were likely to come from ethnic minority populations and have a history of substance abuse. Move than 70 percent of the women who had abortions reported sexual and/or physical assaults as either children or adults. Only 34 percent of all participants indicated that they used contraceptives. Increased awareness of reproductive histories and family planning needs of women with major psychiatric disorders is suggested.

TI  - The impact of Northern Ireland's abortion laws on women's abortion decision-making and experiences
T2  - BMJ SEXUAL & REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Background In Northern Ireland, abortion is illegal except in very limited circumstances to preserve a woman's life or to prevent permanent or long-term injury to her physical or mental health. Abortions conducted outside the law are a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment. We assessed the impacts of Northern Ireland's abortion laws on women's decision-making and experiences in accessing abortion. Methods Between April 2017 and February 2018 we interviewed 30 women living in Northern Ireland who had sought abortion by travelling to a clinic in Great Britain or by using online telemedicine to self-manage a medication abortion at home. We interviewed women both before and after a policy change that allowed women from Northern Ireland access to free abortion services in Great Britain. We used a semi-structured in-depth approach and analysed the interviews using grounded theory methodology to identify key themes.
   Results Four key findings emerged from our analysis: (1) women experience multiple barriers to travelling for abortion services, even when abortion is provided without charge; (2) self-management is often preferred over travel, but its criminalisation engenders fear and isolation; (3) obstruction of import of abortion medications by Northern Ireland Customs contributes to stress, anxiety, a higher risk of complications, and trial of ineffective or unsafe methods; and (4) lack of clarity surrounding the obligations of healthcare professionals in Northern Ireland causes mistrust of the healthcare system.
   Conclusions Northern Ireland's abortion laws negatively affect the quality and safety of women's healthcare and can have serious implications for women's physical and emotional health. Our findings offer new perspectives for the current policy debate over Northern Ireland's abortion laws and suggest a public health rationale for decriminalising abortion.

TI  - An Examination of Intimate Partner Violence and Psychological Stressors in Adult Abortion Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe an exploratory study examining the relationship between intimate partner violence and psychological stressors in a sample of 188 adult abortion patients. Results indicate the almost 15% of respondents report a history of abuse by the coconceiving partner. In addition, women who reported having had one or more past abortions were more likely to also report that the person involved in the current pregnancy had also emotionally abused them. Women reporting one type of partner abuse were significantly more likely to also report other types of abuse. Women reporting abuse were less likely to report informing their coconceiving partner of their appointment at the clinic, less likely to report that their partner contributed financially to the abortion cost, and more likely to report partner refusal to wear a condom. Women who reported emotional abuse were more likely to score higher on all but one of the psychological stressor scales. The implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  - Psychiatrists and termination of pregnancy: Clinical, legal and ethical aspects
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Objective: To provide practical guidance for psychiatrists asked to conduct an assessment of a woman requesting a termination of pregnancy.
   Method: The law relevant to termination of pregnancy in each of the Australian states and territories and in New Zealand was synthesised and reviewed, as was the available literature around the key roles for the psychiatrist in these settings.
   Results: Little is known about the rates of and reasons for terminations in Australasia. The 'lawfulness' of termination varies between jurisdictions and might require a consideration of the woman's mental health. When psychiatrists are asked to assist, their roles can be divided into: assessment and management of the woman's mental health, assessment of the woman's capacity to consent to the termination, assessment of the impact of having a termination or not having a termination upon the woman's mental health, assistance in determining the lawfulness of the proposed termination and, finally, support of the obstetric team providing terminations.
   Conclusions: The psychiatric assessment of a woman requesting a termination of pregnancy requires an understanding of the ethical issues, the relevant law and a clinical framework within which the psychiatrist can delineate his or her various roles.

TI  - Legal abortion in Asturias (Spain) after the 1985 law: Sociodemographic characteristics of women applying for abortion
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Study objective: To describe the use of induced abortion (IA) in Asturias after its legalisation as well as the socio-demographic characteristics of women applying for abortion. Design and setting: Descriptive study, population-based, using data collected by the regional abortion surveillance system for the period 1988-1994. Main results: The number of IA and the abortion rate (AR) (10 per 1000 women aged 15-49) have been stable in Asturias during the study period. The highest ARs were found for women in the age group 20-34, for divorced/separated, for women with a higher educational level and for women with only one child. The proportion of pregnancies which ended in abortion was one in four; for teenagers and women over 34 years it was one in two. This proportion was also higher for women not married, students and women with two or more children. Ninety-eight percent of all abortions took place in private clinics, the woman's physical/mental health being the medical indication for these abortions. Abortion was most often performed within eight weeks of gestation (65%). Late abortion ocurred more frequently among teenagers and women of low educational level. Eighteen percent of women had repeated abortions. A high proportion (61%) of women applying for abortion had not used the Family Planning (FP) services in the previous two years; adolescents and women of low educational level had the lowest frequencies of FP use. Conclusions: Compared with that of other European countries, the AR in Asturias was intermediate. The results regarding adolescents show the need for evaluation and promotion of sex education and contraceptive programmes. The lower and later use of abortion by women of low educational level shows inequalities that call for specific action.

TI  - THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SEQUELAE OF THERAPEUTIC-ABORTION - DENIED AND COMPLETED
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this article is to review the available literature on the psychological sequelae of therapeutic abortion, addressing both the issue of the effects of the abortion on the woman involved and the effects on the woman and on the child born when abortion is denied. Method: Papers reviewed were initially selected by using a Medline search. This procedure resulted in 225 papers being reviewed, which were further selected by limiting the papers to those reporting original research. Finally, studies were assessed as to whether or not they used control groups or objective, validated symptom measures. Results: Adverse sequelae occur in a minority of women, and when such symptoms occur, they usually seem to be the continuation of symptoms that appeared before the abortion and are on the wane immediately after the abortion. Many women denied abortion show ongoing resentment that may last for years, while children born when the abortion is denied have numerous, broadly based difficulties in social, interpersonal, and occupational functions that last at least into early adulthood. Conclusions: With increasing pressure on access to abortion services in North America, nonpsychiatrist physicians and mental health professionals need to keep in mind the effects of both performing and denying therapeutic abortion. Increased research into these areas, focusing in particular on why some women are adversely affected by the procedure and clarifying the relationship issues involved, continues to be important.

TI  - Women's Emotions One Week After Receiving or Being Denied an Abortion in the United States
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - CONTEXT: The notion that abortion causes poor mental health has gained traction, even though it is not supported by research. Few studies have comprehensively investigated women's postabortion emotions.
   METHODS: Baseline data from a longitudinal study of women seeking abortion at 30 U. S. facilities between 2008 and 2010 were used to examine emotions among 843 women who received an abortion just prior to the facility's gestational age limit, were denied an abortion because they presented just beyond the gestational limit or obtained a first-trimester abortion. Multivariable analyses were used to compare women's emotions about their pregnancy and about their receipt or denial of abortion after one week, and to identify variables associated with experiencing primarily negative emotions postabortion.
   RESULTS: Compared with women who obtained a near-limit abortion, those denied the abortion felt more regret and anger (scoring, on average, 0.4-0.5 points higher on a 0-4 scale), and less relief and happiness (scoring 1.4 and 0.3 points lower, respectively). Among women who had obtained the abortion, the greater the extent to which they had planned the pregnancy or had difficulty deciding to seek abortion, the more likely they were to feel primarily negative emotions (odds ratios, 1.2 and 2.5, respectively). Most (95%) women who had obtained the abortion felt it was the right decision, as did 89% of those who expressed regret.
   CONCLUSIONS: Difficulty with the abortion decision and the degree to which the pregnancy had been planned were most important for women's postabortion emotional state. Experiencing negative emotions postabortion is different from believing that abortion was not the right decision.

TI  - Uncovering Prolonged Grief Reactions Subsequent to a Reproductive Loss: Implications for the Primary Care Provider
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Introduction
   There is a paucity of clinical guidelines for the routine assessment of maladaptive reproductive grief reactions in outpatient primary care and OB-GYN settings in the United States. Because of the disenfranchised nature of perinatal grief reactions, many clinicians may be apt to miss or dismiss a grief reaction that was not identified in the perinatal period. A significant number of those experiencing a reproductive loss exhibit signs of anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Reproductive losses are typically screened for and recorded numerically as part of a woman's well-visit intake, yet this process often fails to identify patients emotionally troubled by a prior pregnancy loss. Materials and Methods
   A summative content analysis of 164 recent website blogs from female participants who self-reported having experienced a miscarriage or abortion in their lifetime was conducted. The narratives were reviewed for details regarding the time span between the pregnancy loss and the composition of the blog post. The stories were analyzed for subsequent relationship problems and detrimental mental health conditions. Maladaptive reactions were contrasted for those that indicated a greater than 12 months' time-lapse and those who had not. Results
   More than a third (39.6%) of the women reported in the narrative that at least one year or more had passed since experiencing the miscarriage or abortion. For those women, the median time span between the loss and composing the blog was 4 years with a range of 47 years. Mental health conditions attributed to the reproductive loss by those who reported longer bereavement times included subsequent relationship problems, substance misuse, depression, suicidal ideation, and PTSD. The percent of reported maladaptive issues was more than double (136.9% vs. 63.6%) for those who reported that a year or more had passed since the loss of the pregnancy. Discussion
   Grief reactions following the loss of a pregnancy may be prolonged or delayed for several months which can contribute to adverse biopsychosocial outcomes. Recognition and treatment of maladaptive grief reactions following a pregnancy loss are critical. Screening methods should be enhanced for clinicians in medical office settings to help identify and expedite the appropriate mental health assistance.

TI  - The Association Between Gender Role Norms and Abortion Stigma Among Chinese Heterosexual Adults in Romantic Relationships: The Effect of Ambivalent Sexism, Motherhood Traditionalism, and the Sexual Double Standard
T2  - SEXUALITY RESEARCH AND SOCIAL POLICY
AB  - IntroductionAlthough abortion is not illegal (except sex-selective abortion) in China, abortion stigma may persistently exist, and few studies have examined abortion stigma in a Chinese sample. Furthermore, Chinese women's gender roles have long been restricted by Chinese traditional culture and values of fertility and family. Therefore, this study aimed to understand how gender role norms are associated with stigmatized attitudes toward abortion.MethodsFrom January to February 2022, a total of 798 Chinese participants (518 women and 280 men) aged 18-56 years (M = 29.8, SD = 5.14) who had had sexual intercourse and were involved in heterosexual romantic relationships completed an online survey assessing endorsement of ambivalent sexism, motherhood traditionalism, the sexual double standard, and abortion stigma. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to test the study hypotheses.ResultsThe results showed that participants' higher levels of identification with hostile sexism, motherhood traditionalism, and the traditional sexual double standard were associated with their higher levels of stigmatized attitudes toward abortion. Benevolent sexism was not significantly associated with stigmatized attitudes toward abortion. In addition, participants' experience of abortion was significantly associated with their less stigmatized attitudes toward abortion.ConclusionsThe findings confirm that traditional gender roles demonstrate potentially detrimental effects on people's attitudes toward abortion.Policy ImplicationsSexuality education should promote gender equality education and raise comprehensive awareness of sexual and reproductive health. Family planning services should place more emphasis on post-abortion mental health care.

TI  - Association between induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility respectively and the risk of psychiatric disorders in 57,770 women followed in gynecological practices in Germany
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Aim: Our goal was to analyze the association between induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility respectively and the risk of psychiatric disorders in 57,770 women followed in gynecological practices in Germany.
   Methods: This case-control study was based on data from the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA). Women with a first documentation of depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, or somatoform disorder in one of 281 gynecological practices in Germany between January 2013 and December 2017 were included in this study (index date). Controls without depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, or somatoform disorder were matched (1:1) to cases by age, index year, and physician. A total of 57,770 women were included in the present study. The main outcome of the study was the risk of psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, somatoform disorder) as a function of induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility.
   Results: The mean age was 29.2 years (SD = 6.4 years) in women with and without psychiatric disorders. Induced abortion (odds ratios [ORs] ranging from 1.75 to 2.01), spontaneous abortion (ORs ranging from 2.16 to 2.60), and infertility (OR = 2.13) were positively associated with the risk of psychiatric disorders.
   Conclusions: A positive relationship between induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility respectively and psychiatric disorders was observed in gynecological practices in Germany.

TI  - Safe abortion: A right for refugees?
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS
AB  - Thanks to initiatives since 1994, most reproductive health programmes for refugee women now include family planning and safe delivery care. Emergency contraception and post-abortion care for complications of unsafe abortion are recommended, but provision of these services has lagged behind, while services for women who wish to terminate an unwanted pregnancy are almost non-existent. Given conditions in refugee settings, including high levels of sexual violence, unwanted pregnancies are of particular concern. Yet the extent of need for abortion services among refugee women remains undocumented. UNFPA estimates that 25-50% of maternal deaths in refugee settings are due to complications of unsafe abortion. Barriers to providing abortion services may include internal and external political pressure, legal restrictions, or the religious affiliation of service providers. Women too may be pressured to continue pregnancies and are often unable to express their needs or assert their rights. Abortion advocacy efforts should highlight the specific needs of refugee women and encourage provision of services where abortion is legally indicated, especially in cases of rape or incest, and risk to a woman's physical and mental health. Implementation of existing guidelines on reducing the occurrence and consequences of sexual violence in refugee settings is also important. Including refugee women in international campaigns for expanded access to safe abortion is critical in addressing the specific needs of this population. (C) 2002 Reproductive Health Matters.

TI  - Do Depression and Low Self-Esteem Follow Abortion Among Adolescents? Evidence from a National Study
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - CONTEXT: A 2008 report by the American Psychological Association found no evidence that an induced abortion causes mental health problems in adult women. No conclusions were drawn with respect to adolescents because of a scarcity of evidence.
   METHODS: Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were used to examine whether abortion in adolescence was associated with subsequent depression and low self-esteem. In all, 289 female respondents reported at least one pregnancy between Wave 1 (1994-1995) and Wave 2 (1996) of the survey. Of these, 69 reported an induced abortion. Population-averaged lagged logistic regression models were used to assess associations between abortion and depression and low self-esteem within a year of the pregnancy and approximately five years later, at Wave 3 (2001-2002).
   RESULTS: Abortion was not associated with depression or low self-esteem at either time point. Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics did not substantially modify the relationships between abortion and the outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents who have an abortion do not appear to be at elevated risk for depression or low self-esteem in the short term or up to five years after the abortion. Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, 2010, 42(4):230-235, doi:10.1363/4223010

TI  - Abortion among young women and subsequent life outcomes
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - CONTEXT. Young women frequently cite concerns about the effects of unplanned pregnancies on future life course outcomes, including education, employment and relationships, as reasons for seeking abortion. There is relatively little evidence as to whether abortion leads to improved life course outcomes for young women who choose this option.
   METHODS: Data from 492 women participating in a 25-year longitudinal study of a New Zealand birth cohort were used in regression models that examined the relationship between pregnancy and abortion history prior to age 27 and selected social and economic outcomes at ages 21-25.
   RESULTS: Compared with young women who become pregnant before age 21 but did not seek an abortion, young women who had an abortion had significantly better outcomes on six out of 10 measures spanning education, income, welfare dependence and domestic violence. Adjustment for confounding factors indicated that most of these differences were explained by family, social and educational characteristics that were present prior to pregnancy. Nonetheless, even after adjustment for confounding factors, young women who had abortions had higher levels of subsequent educational achievement than those who became pregnant but did not have abortions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Abortion may mitigate some effects of early unplanned pregnancy. However, further study of its potential risks and benefits is needed so that women can make fully informed decisions as to whether to terminate unintended pregnancies.

TI  - Determinants of induced abortion delay
T2  - GACETA SANITARIA
AB  - Background: In induced abortion, the method, the risk of complications and the economic cost of the abortion are determined by gestational age. The aim of this study was to describe the determinants of induced abortion delay until the second trimester of pregnancy in Barcelona.
   Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of induced abortions due to the physical or mental health of the woman (Barcelona, 2004-2005: N = 9,175). The city's induced abortion register provided data on gestational age at abortion (dependent variable), educational level, age, cohabitation with the partner, number of children previous abortions, and type of center. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were calculated with log-binomial regression models.
   Results: A total of 7.7% of induced abortions were second-trimester abortions and 99.3% were performed in private centers. Compared with women with a university education, those with primary education or less had an aPR of 1.8 (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.4-2.2) of delaying the abortion until the second trimester. A higher proportion of second-trimester abortions were also recorded in women aged less than 18 years old (aPR = 2.6; 95%CI: 2.0-3.4), women not cohabiting with their partners (aRP = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2-1.6) and in public centers (aPR = 2.8; 95%CI: 2.2-3.7). No differences were found in induced abortion delay among women with previous abortions and those without.
   Conclusion: Induced abortion delay until the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with low educational level, young ages, not cohabiting with a partner, and public centers. This study demonstrates the existence of socioeconomic inequalities in access conditions to abortion services. (C) 2008 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

TI  - Depression and associated psychosocial factors following a legal abortion in Mexico
T2  - REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE PSICOLOGIA
AB  - Introduction: Scientific evidence from the United States and European countries shows that women who have had an induced abortion are not more likely to become depressed and several factors may confound this outcome. In contrast, in the case of Latin America, the-re are practically no studies in this regard due to restrictive legislation prevailing in the region. This paper aims to determine the prevalence of a probable major depressive episode (PMDE) in women who have legally terminated a pregnancy by way of public service in Mexico City and whether there are any psychosocial factors reported by the international literature associated with this outcome. Method: In a cross-sectional study, 274 women aged 15 years or older were interviewed two weeks after undergoing a medical abortion between November 2018 and November 2019. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale 35-item version (CES-D-R35) was used to measure the PMDE in a structured interview. Results: The prevalence of a PMDE was 15.8%. Multivariate logistic regression was used for adjusted analysis. Perceived abor-tion stigma (OR = 6.74, 95% CI = 3.29-13.82), child sexual abuse (OR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.01-4.93), and previous childless pregnancies (OR = 6.07, 95% CI = 1.52-24.21) were associated with PMDE. Conclusions: The prevalence of PMDE is similar to or lower than that reported in studies with women who continued a pregnancy; post-abortion counseling and clinical considerations should include the impact that stigma and gender-based violence have on women's mental health.

TI  - Abortion method preference among people presenting for abortion care
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Objective: To explore abortion method preference, interpersonal and cultural factors associated with preference, and whether, among people with a preference for medication abortion, those presenting past 10 weeks gestation had experienced more obstacles to care.
   Methods: In 2019, we invited people aged 15 to 45 years presenting to 4 U.S. abortion clinics to complete a self-administered, anonymous iPad survey prior to seeing the health care provider. Questions focused on their pregnancy, including self-reported gestational age and experiences accessing abortion care, including abortion method preference. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess associations between worry about perceived pregnancy-related stigma or abortion-related health myths and abortion method preference.
   Results: The majority (784 [77%]) of those approached (1092) initiated the survey and 712 responded to the preference question. Most (597 [84%]) preferred a method: 246 (41%) preferred medication abortion and 351 (59%) an in-clinic procedure. About one-third (110 [32%]) of those preferring medication abortions exceeded 10 weeks gestation and 83% (n = 91) had experienced delay-causing obstacles to care. In multivariate analyses, we found a greater odd of preference for medication abortion over in-clinic procedure among those very worried about people's reaction to the pregnancy (adjusted OR [a0R] 1.95, 95% CI 1.16-3.28), judgment from God or religion (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.17-3.19) and abortion affecting mental health (aOR 2.51, 95% CI 1.45-4.34) or ability to get pregnant later (aOR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.09-2.97).
   Conclusions: Many people seeking abortion have a method preference; delayed presentation to care may impede ability to obtain desired method. Pregnancy-related stigma and misinformation are associated with preference for medication abortion.
   Implications statement: Pregnancy-related stigma and misinformation, such as health and safety myths promulgated by state-mandated abortion counseling, may motivate preference for medication abortion. Abortion access obstacles may impede individuals' ability to obtain their preferred method. Removing barriers to clinic access may enhance people's ability to obtain their preferred abortion method.

TI  - Abortion and subsequent mental health: Review of the literature
T2  - PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES
AB  - The risk that abortion may be correlated with subsequent mental disorders needs a careful assessment, in order to offer women full information when facing a difficult pregnancy. All research papers published between 1995 and 2011, were examined, to retrieve those assessing any correlation between abortion and subsequent mental problems. A total of 36 studies were retrieved, and six of them were excluded for methodological bias. Depression, anxiety disorders (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder) and substance abuse disorders were the most studied outcome. Abortion versus childbirth: 13 studies showed a clear risk for at least one of the reported mental problems in the abortion group versus childbirth, five papers showed no difference, in particular if women do not consider their experience of fetal loss to be difficult, or if after a fetal reduction the desired fetus survives. Only one paper reported a worse mental outcome for childbearing. Abortion versus unplanned pregnancies ending with childbirth: four studies found a higher risk in the abortion groups and three, no difference. Abortion versus miscarriage: three studies showed a greater risk of mental disorders due to abortion, four found no difference and two found that short-term anxiety and depression were higher in the miscarriage group, while long-term anxiety and depression were present only in the abortion group. In conclusion, fetal loss seems to expose women to a higher risk for mental disorders than childbirth; some studies show that abortion can be considered a more relevant risk factor than miscarriage; more research is needed in this field.

TI  - Another disaster: Access to abortion after Hurricane Harvey
T2  - HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The devastating effects of natural hazards uncover and exacerbate social inequalities, yet reproductive health outcomes are often overlooked. Despite a small but growing literature on gender and disaster-related impacts, there are no studies to date to our knowledge on the intersection of abortion and disasters, which is important because abortion is common in the U.S. and is a critical component of comprehensive reproductive healthcare yet is routinely inaccessible due to a lack of health insurance coverage and other policy barriers. This is a qualitative case study of 8 individuals who required abortion services in Texas at the time of Hurricane Harvey. The study sample comes from caller data from a local Texas abortion fund. We present caller demographics, which reveal nonwhite patients in later trimesters struggling economically. Callers display a need for funding, particularly for travel, and were affected by interpersonal and sexual violence. We conclude with policy and research implications for disaster planners, domestic violence organizations, state and federal officials, and health insurers.

TI  - Is There an oAbortion Trauma Syndromeo? Critiquing the Evidence
T2  - HARVARD REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - The objective of this review is to identify and illustrate methodological issues in studies used to support claims that induced abortion results in an oabortion trauma syndromeo or a psychiatric disorder. After identifying key methodological issues to consider when evaluating such research, we illustrate these issues by critically examining recent empirical studies that are widely cited in legislative and judicial testimony in support of the existence of adverse psychiatric sequelae of induced abortion. Recent studies that have been used to assert a causal connection between abortion and subsequent mental disorders are marked by methodological problems that include, but not limited to: poor sample and comparison group selection; inadequate conceptualization and control of relevant variables; poor quality and lack of clinical significance of outcome measures; inappropriateness of statistical analyses; and errors of interpretation, including misattribution of causal effects. By way of contrast, we review some recent major studies that avoid these methodological errors. The most consistent predictor of mental disorders after abortion remains preexisting disorders, which, in turn, are strongly associated with exposure to sexual abuse and intimate violence. Educating researchers, clinicians, and policymakers how to appropriately assess the methodological quality of research about abortion outcomes is crucial. Further, methodologically sound research is needed to evaluate not only psychological outcomes of abortion, but also the impact of existing legislation and the effects of social attitudes and behaviors on women who have abortions.

TI  - Abortion Stigma: A Systematic Review
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - CONTEXT: Although stigma has been identified as a potential risk factor for the well-being of women who have had abortions, little attention has been paid to the study of abortion-related stigma.
   METHODS: A systematic search of the databases Medline, PsycArticles, PsycInfo, PubMed and Web of Science was conducted; the search terms were "(abortion OR pregnancy termination) AND stigma*." Articles were eligible for inclusion if the main research question addressed experiences of individuals subjected to abortion stigma, public attitudes that stigmatize women who have had abortions or interventions aimed at managing abortion stigma. To provide a comprehensive overview of this issue, any study published by February 2015 was considered. The search was restricted to English-and German-language studies.
   RESULTS: Seven quantitative and seven qualitative studies were eligible for inclusion. All but two dated from 2009 or later; the earliest was from 1984. Studies were based mainly on U.S. samples; some included participants from Ghana, Great Britain, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru and Zambia. The majority of studies showed that women who have had abortions experience fear of social judgment, self-judgment and a need for secrecy. Secrecy was associated with increased psychological distress and social isolation. Some studies found stigmatizing attitudes in the public. Stigma appeared to be salient in abortion providers' lives. Evidence of interventions to reduce abortion stigma was scarce. Most studies had limitations regarding generalizability and validity.
   CONCLUSION: More research, using validated measures, is needed to enhance understanding of abortion stigma and thereby reduce its impact on affected individuals.

TI  - History of induced abortions and frailty in older Greek women: results from the HELIAD study
T2  - EUROPEAN GERIATRIC MEDICINE
AB  - Purpose Women are almost twice as likely as men to develop frailty and early-traumatic experiences related to reproduction may have a role to play. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between a history of induced abortions and risk of frailty.
   Methods 1062 women aged >= 65 years from the HELIAD study were included in the present cross-sectional study. Frailty was assessed by frailty index and Fried definitions. The history of abortion and of other reproductive experiences (age onset of menstruation, age of menopause, number of offspring, and number of miscarriages) was obtained by all participants. Logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to examine whether the number of abortions was related to frailty.
   Results When frailty was defined with frailty index, women with 1 or 2 abortions had 1.7 higher risk of frailty compared to women with no history of abortions, while those with more than 3 abortions had more than a twofold higher risk of frailty. Two supplementary analyses excluding women with surgical operations' history and women with dementia revealed similar results. When frailty was defined with Fried definition, the analysis was marginally significant when abortion was inserted as a categorical variable. Women with more than 3 abortions showed 2.4 higher risk of frailty compared to women with no history of abortion.
   Conclusion The number of induced abortions was associated with moderate higher odds of frailty, when frailty was defined according to frailty index. A similar trend was revealed in the model with Fried definition after trichotomization of abortions.

TI  - Emotions and decision rightness over five years following an abortion: An examination of decision difficulty and abortion stigma
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Despite weak theoretical grounding and ample research indicating women feel high levels of decision rightness and relief post-abortion, claims that abortion is inherently stressful and causes emergent negative emotions and regret undergirds state-level laws regulating abortion in the United States. Nonetheless, scholarship does identify factors that put a woman at risk for short-term negative postabortion emotions including decision difficulty and perceiving abortion stigma in ones community pointing to a possible mechanism behind later emergent or persistent post-abortion negative emotions.
   Methods: Using five years of longitudinal data, collected one week post-abortion and semi-annually for five years from women who sought abortions at 30 US facilities between 2008 and 2010, we examined women's emotions and feeling that abortion was the right decision over five years (n=667). We used mixed effects regression models to examine changes in emotions and abortion decision rightness over time by decision difficulty and perceived community abortion stigma.
   Results: We found no evidence of emerging negative emotions or abortion decision regret; both positive and negative emotions declined over the first two years and plateaued thereafter, and decision rightness remained high and steady (predicted percent: 97.5% at baseline, 99.0% at five years). At five years postabortion, relief remained the most commonly felt emotion among all women (predicted mean on 0-4 scale: 1.0; 0.6 for sadness and guilt; 0.4 for regret, anger and happiness). Despite converging levels of emotions by decision difficulty and stigma level over time, these two factors remained most important for predicting negative emotions and decision non-rightness years later.
   Conclusions: These results add to the scientific evidence that emotions about an abortion are associated with personal and social context, and are not a product of the abortion procedure itself. Findings challenge the rationale for policies regulating access to abortion that are premised on emotional harm claims.

TI  - Clandestine abortion in Mexico: A question of mental as well as physical health
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS
AB  - This paper reports on research carried out in Mexico City in 1995-1996 on the meaning of motherhood, contraception, an unwanted pregnancy or child, and the experience of illegal, clandestine abortion, as described by 12 women of different ages, class, education and marital status who had one or more clandestine abortions. A priest, two doctors from the public health system, a group of gynaecologists and nurses and a health social worker were also interviewed. The data show that it is the illegal and clandestine nature of abortion that has a negative effect on women in Mexico. Although terminating a pregnancy can also be a difficult experience in itself, it became traumatic for most (though not all) of the women interviewed due to the dominant Catholic church doctrine that abortion is a sin, and because of the criminal law punishing those who have abortions, which forces women to have the procedure in high risk conditions, all of which adversely affected their mental and physical health. In spite of this, all the women considered abortion a personal decision that they had to make. Even those who believed that termination of pregnancy was the transgression of a divine commandment also believed that it was a rightful and necessary decision, given their circumstances.

TI  - Abortion: the Portuguese case
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS
AB  - Abortion was completely illegal in Portugal until 1984. Illegal abortion provision was a matter of silence until then and treated as a "black market" issue rather than as a health issue. The first attempts to change the abortion law began in 1982 after two trials and a national campaign for legal abortion and contraception. In 1984, the law was changed and abortion became legal on four grounds: risk to the woman's life, risk to her physical or mental health, fetal malformation and pregnancy resulting from rape. At the beginning of the 1990s, the Family Planning Association (APF), some women's organisations, trade unions, health professional associations and other NGOs came together to form the Right to Choose Platform. In 1993 a Report on the Abortion Situation in Portugal was presented to the Parliament and Ministries of Health and Justice, followed by public debates. In 1998 the law was changed to allow existing grounds to be applied beyond 12 weeks of pregnancy but bills and a referendum to make abortion available on request to 12 weeks of pregnancy were lost by a tiny margin twice in this period. At the end of 2001 the biggest trial on illegal abortion started in Maia, a small town in the north of the country, which had an immediate and enormous impact on public opinion. An increasing number of public opinion-makers, some prestigious health professionals and even the President of the Republic have recently declared that the law should be changed. The election of a right-wing parliamentary majority in March 2002, however, means that abortion law reform will again be postponed. (C) 2002 Reproductive Health Matters.

TI  - The Burden of Abortion Restrictions and Conservative Diagnostic Guidelines on Patient-Centered Care for Early Pregnancy Loss
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Intrauterine pregnancies of uncertain viability are common, and guidelines for diagnosing early pregnancy loss must balance the risk of interrupting a viable pregnancy with the anxiety and medical complications resulting from delayed diagnosis. Two cases of likely early pregnancy loss presenting as intrauterine pregnancies of uncertain viability are described, with stark differences in care availability related to state reproductive health care regulations. Onerous abortion restrictions, medical and societal stigma, and inherent pronatalism in diagnostic criteria interfere with the exercise of clinical judgment and can damage patients' physical or mental health.

AB  - This study analyzed thousands of women's online conversations in relation to their miscarriage or abortion experiences, classified as unplanned and planned traumas, respectively. Linguistic Inquiry Word Count text analysis revealed that people experiencing a planned trauma use distancing language patterns in higher frequency and engage in emotion regulation more than those who experienced trauma unexpectedly. On the other hand, planned trauma conversations used more self-focused language and more social-based language. Implications and future directions for trauma research are discussed.

TI  - Personal resilience, cognitive appraisals, and coping: An integrative model of adjustment to abortion
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - We hypothesized that the effects of personality (self-esteem, control, and optimism) on postabortion adaptation (distress, well-being, and decision satisfaction) would be fully mediated by preabortion cognitive appraisals (stress appraisals and self-efficacy appraisals) and postabortion coping. We further proposed that the effects of preabortion appraisals on adaptation would be fully mediated by postabortion coping. Results of a longitudinal study of 527 women who had first-trimester abortions supported our hypotheses. Women with more resilient personalities appraised their abortion as less stressful and had higher self-efficacy for coping with the abortion. More positive appraisals predicted greater acceptance/reframing coping and lesser avoidance/denial, venting, support seeking, and religious coping. Acceptance-reframing predicted better adjustment on all measures, whereas avoidance-denial and venting related to poorer adjustment on all measures. Greater support seeking was associated with reduced distress, and greater religious coping was associated with less decision satisfaction.

TI  - The course of mental health after miscarriage and induced abortion: a longitudinal, five-year follow-up study
T2  - BMC MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Miscarriage and induced abortion are life events that can potentially cause mental distress. The objective of this study was to determine whether there are differences in the patterns of normalization of mental health scores after these two pregnancy termination events.
   Methods: Forty women who experienced miscarriages and 80 women who underwent abortions at the main hospital of Buskerud County in Norway were interviewed. All subjects completed the following questionnaires 10 days (T1), six months (T2), two years (T3) and five years (T4) after the pregnancy termination: Impact of Event Scale (IES), Quality of Life, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and another addressing their feelings about the pregnancy termination. Differential changes in mean scores were determined by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and inter-group differences were assessed by ordinary least squares methods.
   Results: Women who had experienced a miscarriage had more mental distress at 10 days and six months after the pregnancy termination than women who had undergone an abortion. However, women who had had a miscarriage exhibited significantly quicker improvement on IES scores for avoidance, grief, loss, guilt and anger throughout the observation period. Women who experienced induced abortion had significantly greater IES scores for avoidance and for the feelings of guilt, shame and relief than the miscarriage group at two and five years after the pregnancy termination (IES avoidance means: 3.2 vs 9.3 at T3, respectively, p < 0.001; 1.5 vs 8.3 at T4, respectively, p < 0.001). Compared with the general population, women who had undergone induced abortion had significantly higher HADS anxiety scores at all four interviews (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001), while women who had had a miscarriage had significantly higher anxiety scores only at T1 (p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: The course of psychological responses to miscarriage and abortion differed during the five-year period after the event. Women who had undergone an abortion exhibited higher scores during the follow-up period for some outcomes. The difference in the courses of responses may partly result from the different characteristics of the two pregnancy termination events.

TI  - Pregnancy resulting from sexual abuse: Reasons alleged by Brazilian women for carrying out the abortion - Pregnancy and violence
T2  - HEALTHMED
AB  - Objective: to know the reasons for women to perform the abortion when in pregnancy resulting from sexual violence.
   Method: A descriptive study of 43 women aged 19-44 years who carried out legally permitted abortion between January 2000 and June 2007. It was applied a structured questionnaire with open questions to unstimulated multiple responses. It was analyzed the typification of the perpetrators of sexual violence, kind of intimidation, women's activity at the moment of the approach; information about the right to abortion; person consulted about the decision, post-abortion feelings and reasons for the choice.
   Results: sexual violence committed by strangers predominated (65.1%), through threat (46.5%) and during daily activities (83.7%). The Police were the main source of information on abortion (44.2%). The decision to interrupt the pregnancy was made alone by 41.9% of the women. Among the reasons for abortion, the rejection of the pregnancy was found in 88.4% of respondents; connection with violence in 86.0%; violation of the right to decide about motherhood in 76.7%, fear of social and family negative effect for the future child in 44.2%, and fear of psychological damage in 18.6%. Relief after the abortion was reported by 74.4% and no case of repentance.
   Conclusions: the decision-making on abortion had close ties with the sexual violence and the expectation of social or psychological harm to the unborn child.

TI  - Psychosocial adjustment after induced abortion and its explanatory factors among adolescent and adult women
T2  - JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE AND INFANT PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Objective: To compare the depressive symptoms and quality of life (QoL) among adolescents (<20years) and adult women who have had an abortion and to explore individual, social, relational and decision-making explanatory factors for (mal)adjustment in each group.Background: International findings are not consistent regarding the presence of negative psychosocial outcomes after abortion or about the explanatory factors for occurrence among adolescents and adult women.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 177 adolescents (65.1%) and 95 adult women (34.9%) who underwent abortion were recruited. Data on individual, social, relational and decision-making characteristics, depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and QoL (EUROHIS-QOL-8) were collected through self-report questionnaires at 16 healthcare services that provide abortion.Results: Although adolescents are not at greater risk of maladjustment than adult women, abortion may be an emotionally significant event for both age groups. Regarding adolescents, feelings of being pressured into abortion and lower satisfaction with the abortion decision were significantly associated with depressive symptoms and lower QoL. Lower support from the mother was also associated with lower QoL. With regard to adult women, lower satisfaction with the abortion decision was significantly associated with depressive symptoms. None of variables was significantly associated with QoL.Conclusion: Our results suggest that adolescents are not at greater risk of psychosocial maladjustment than are adult women. Factors from different ecological contexts and specific factors depending on age group should be considered in preventive interventions for (mal)adjustment after abortion.

TI  - PSYCHIATRIC MORBIDITY IN A PREGNANT POPULATION IN NIGERIA
T2  - GENERAL HOSPITAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Psychiatric morbidity among 240 pregnant women attending an antenatal unit was assessed by a two-stage screening procedure, using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30) and Present State Examination Schedule (PSE). The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was found to be significantly associated with younger age (<24 years), being primigravid, married for less than 1 year, having an unsupportive husband, and a previous history of induced abortion. It is suggested that more attention needs to be paid to the mental health of pregnant women in developing countries (where pregnancy rates and the risks associated with pregnancy/delivery are much higher than in the developed countries) at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of health care.

TI  - Well-Being Before and After Pregnancy Termination: The Consequences of Abortion and Miscarriage on Satisfaction With Various Domains of Life
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES
AB  - The consequences of pregnancy outcomes other than live birth on subjective well-being have rarely been analysed in research to date. This study examines pre-event determinants as well as the temporary and long-term effects of induced abortion and miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) on satisfaction with various domains of life. The data were derived from the German Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (pairfam). The longitudinal sample consists of 5331 women of reproductive age, of whom 214 women had an induced abortion, 331 women had a miscarriage, and 1156 women had a live birth during the observation period. First, pre-event measures of women who had an induced abortion and women who had a miscarriage were compared with the pre-event measures of those women who gave birth. Second, fixed effects models were used to examine whether overall or domain-specific life satisfaction changed following a pregnancy termination. The results show that pregnancies resulting in abortion or miscarriage were less frequently preceded by pregnancy intentions compared to those resulting in live birth, and that induced abortion-but not miscarriage-was furthermore accompanied by lower pre-event satisfaction than live birth. Following both miscarriage and induced abortion, women experienced temporary declines in overall life satisfaction and showed persistently lower satisfaction in several domains of life. With regard to induced abortion, pre-event measures were a better predictor of overall well-being than the consequences of the event itself. Low life satisfaction might therefore be a risk factor for having an abortion rather than a result.

AB  - Background: Malaysia has relatively liberal abortion laws in that they permit abortions for both physical and mental health cases. However, abortion remains a taboo subject. The stagnating contraceptive prevalence rate combined with the plunging fertility rate suggests that abortion might be occurring clandestinely. This qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of women and their needs with regard to abortion.
   Methods: Women from diverse backgrounds were purposively selected from an urban family planning clinic in Penang, Malaysia based on inclusion criteria of being aged 21 and above and having experienced an induced abortion. A semi-structured interview guide consisting of open ended questions eliciting women's experiences and needs with regard to abortion were utilized to facilitate the interviews. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically.
   Results: Thirty-one women, with ages ranging from 21-43 years (mean 30.16 +/- 6.41), who had induced surgical/medical abortions were recruited from an urban family planning clinic. Ten women reported only to have had one previous abortion while the remaining had multiple abortions ranging from 2-8 times. The findings revealed that although women had abortions, nevertheless they faced problems in seeking for abortion information and services. They also had fears about the consequences and side effects of abortion and wish to receive more information on abortion. Women with post-abortion feelings ranged from no feelings to not wanting to think about the abortion, relief, feeling of sadness and loss. Abortion decisions were primarily theirs but would seek partner/husband's agreement. In terms of the women's needs for abortion, or if they wished for more information on abortion, pre and post abortion counseling and post-abortion follow up.
   Conclusions: The existing abortion laws in Malaysia should enable the government to provide abortion services within the law. Unfortunately, the study findings show that this is generally not so, most probably due to social stigma. There is an urgent need for the government to review its responsibility in providing accessible abortion services within the scope of the law and to look into the regulatory requirements for such services in Malaysia. This study also highlighted the need for educational efforts to make women aware of their reproductive rights and also to increase their reproductive knowledge pertaining to abortion. Besides the government, public education on abortion may also be improved by efforts from abortion providers, advocacy groups and related NGOs.

TI  - Intended pregnancy after receiving vs. being denied a wanted abortion
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Objectives: To understand how having or being denied an abortion affects the likelihood of trying to become pregnant, overall pregnancy rates, and the rate and timing of an intended pregnancy in the future.
   Study design: The Turnaway Study is a prospective cohort study of women who received or were denied a wanted abortion. Women were recruited from one of 30 US abortion facilities. We examined subsequent intended pregnancy among those who presented just under the facility's gestational limit and received an abortion (Near-Limit Abortion Group, n=413) and those who presented for abortion just beyond the facility's gestational limit, were denied an abortion and went on to parent the child (Parenting Turnaways, n=146). First, we modeled the probability of trying to become pregnant using multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression. We then used Cox proportional-hazards models to compare overall pregnancy rates and intended pregnancy rates over 5 years.
   Results: Parenting Turnaways had lower predicted probabilities of reporting trying to become pregnant in the first 1.5 years after birth/abortion than the Near-Limit Abortion Group. They also had lower pregnancy rates overall [40.4 per 100 woman-years vs. 53.5 per 100 woman-years, adjusted hazards ratio (aHR)=0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.54-0.89]. The 5-year intended pregnancy rate was low among both groups, but compared to the Near-Limit Abortion Group, Parenting Turnaways had a lower intended pregnancy rate (2.2 per 100 woman-years vs. 7.5 per 100 woman-years, aHR=0.29, 95% CI: 0.10-0.85).
   Conclusion: Being able to obtain a wanted abortion may enable women to have an intended pregnancy later.
   Implications: Ensuring that women can obtain an abortion for an unwanted pregnancy may enable them to have a subsequent pregnancy when they are ready to have a baby. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A cross-sectional study examining consideration of self-managed abortion among people seeking facility-based care in the United States
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Introduction With increasing restrictions on abortion across the United States, we sought to understand whether people seeking abortion would consider ending their pregnancy on their own if unable to access a facility-based abortion. Methods From January to June 2019, we surveyed patients seeking abortion at 4 facilities in 3 US states. We explored consideration of self-managed abortion (SMA) using responses to the question: "Would you consider ending this pregnancy on your own if you are unable to obtain care at a health care facility?" We used multivariable Poisson regression to assess associations between individual sociodemographic, pregnancy and care-seeking characteristics and prevalence of considering SMA. In bivariate Poisson models, we also explored whether consideration of SMA differed by specific obstacles to abortion care. Results One-third (34%) of 741 participants indicated they would definitely or probably consider ending the pregnancy on their own if unable to obtain care at a facility. Consideration of SMA was higher among those who reported no health insurance (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.66; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.12-2.44), described the pregnancy as unintended (aPR = 1.53; 95% CI 1.08-2.16), were seeking abortion due to concerns about their own physical or mental health (aPR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.02, 2.20), or experienced obstacles that delayed their abortion care seeking (aPR = 2.26, 95% CI 1.49, 3.40). Compared to those who would not consider SMA, participants who would consider SMA expressed higher difficulty finding an abortion facility (35 vs. 27%, p = 0.019), figuring out how to get to the clinic (29 vs 21%, p = 0.021) and needing multiple clinic visits (23 vs 17%, p = 0.044). Conclusions. One in three people seeking facility-based abortion would consider SMA if unable to obtain abortion care at a facility. As abortion access becomes increasingly restricted in the US, SMA may become more common. Future research should continue to monitor people's consideration and use of SMA and ensure that they have access to safe and effective methods.

TI  - Assessing the impact of TRAP laws on abortion and women's health in the USA: a systematic review
T2  - BMJ SEXUAL & REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Introduction Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (TRAP) laws impose extensive and sometimes costly requirements on abortion providers and facilities, potentially leading to barriers to care. Understanding the impact of these laws is important given their prevalence in the USA, but no review to date has summarised the available evidence. We conducted a systematic review of literature on TRAP laws and their impact on abortion trends and women's health.
   Methods We searched MEDLINE, PubMed and EconLit for original, quantitative studies where the exposure was at least one TRAP policy and the outcome was abortion and/or any women's physical or mental health outcome.
   Results Six articles met our inclusion criteria. The most common outcome was population-level abortion trends; studies also assessed the effect of TRAP laws on gestational age at presentation and measures of self-perceived burden. While certain TRAP laws (eg, admitting privilege requirements) appeared to have an effect on abortion outcomes, the impact of other laws - or combinations of laws - was unclear, due in part to heterogeneity between studies with respect to study design, geography, and exposure definition.
   Conclusions TRAP laws may have an impact on the experience of obtaining an abortion in the USA. However, our review revealed a paucity of empirical research on their population and individual-level impact, as well as some disagreement about the effect of different TRAP laws on subsequent abortion outcomes. Future research should prioritise the specific TRAP laws that may have a uniquely strong effect on state-level abortion rates and other outcomes.

TI  - Internalized Stigma and Stigma-Related Isolation Predict Women's Psychological Distress and Physical Health Symptoms Post-Abortion
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY
AB  - Researchers have provided evidence that accessing abortion relates to anticipated, experienced, and internalized stigma. These aspects of stigma have previously been associated with increased psychological distress and physical health symptoms. However, there has been no research on how anticipation, perception, internalization, and stigma-related isolation are related to psychological distress and somatic (physical) symptoms. We examined this question in an online volunteer sample of women in Ireland (N = 155) who have had an abortion. Internalized stigma and stigma-related isolation significantly predicted higher levels of psychological distress, and internalized stigma also significantly predicted somatic symptoms. The direct effect of each type of stigma on somatic symptoms was mediated by psychological distress. Thus, to the extent that women had internalized greater stigma and isolated themselves, they also reported increased psychological distress, and this psychological distress predicted increased somatic symptoms. The relation between internalized stigma and somatic symptoms was also moderated by stigma-related isolation. Our findings complement and extend the existing literature on the relations between stigmatized identities, psychological distress, and physical health problems, particularly regarding women who have accessed abortion. They also indicate that those involved in policy-making and activism around reproductive rights should avoid inadvertently increasing the stigma surrounding abortion.

TI  - Racial and Ethnic Abortion Disparities Following Georgia's 22-Week Gestational Age Limit
T2  - WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES
AB  - Introduction: Georgia's 2012 House Bill 954 (HB954) prohibiting abortions after 22 weeks from last menstrual period (LMP) has been associated with a significant decrease in abortions after 22 weeks. However, the policy's effects by race or ethnicity remain unexplored. We investigated whether changes in abortion numbers and ratios (per 1,000 live births) in Georgia after HB954 varied by race or ethnicity.
   Methods: Using Georgia Department of Public Health induced terminations of pregnancy data from 2007 to 2017, we examined changes in number of abortions and abortion ratios (per 1,000 live births) by race and ethnicity following HB954 implementation.
   Results: After full implementation of HB954 in 2015, the number of abortions and abortion ratios at or after 22 weeks (from last menstrual period) decreased among White (b(Number) = -261.83, p < .001; b(Ratio) = -3.31, p < .001), Black (b(Number) = -416.17, p < .001; b(Ratio) = -8.84, p < .001), non-Hispanic (bNumber = -667.00, p = .001; b(Ratio) = -5.82, p < .001), and Hispanic (b(Number) = -56.25, p = .002; b(Ratio) = -2.44, p = .002) people. However, the ratio of abortions before 22 weeks increased for Black people (b(LessThan22Weeks) = 44.06, p = .028) and remained stable for White (b(LessThan22Weeks) = -6.78, p = .433), Hispanic (b(LessThan22Weeks) = 21.27, p = .212), and non-Hispanic people (b(LessThan22Weeks) = 26.93, p = .172).
   Conclusion: The full implementation of HB954 had differential effects by race/ethnicity and gestational age. Although abortion at 22 weeks or more decreased for all groups, abortion at less than 22 weeks increased among Black people. Additional research should elucidate the possible causes, consequences, and reactions to differential effects of abortion restrictions by race and ethnicity. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Suicides after pregnancy in Finland, 1987-94: Register linkage study
T2  - BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Objective-To determine rates of suicide associated with pregnancy by the type of pregnancy.
   Design-Register linkage study. information on suicides in women of reproductive age was Linked with the Finnish birth, abortion, and hospital discharge registers to find out how many women who committed suicide had had a completed pregnancy during her last year of life.
   Setting-Nationwide data from Finland.
   Subjects-Women who committed suicide in 1987-94.
   Results-There were 73 suicides associated with pregnancy, representing 5.4% of all suicides in women in this age group. The mean annual suicide rate was 11.3 per 100 000. The suicide rate associated with birth was significantly lower (5.9) and the rates associated with miscarriage (18.1) and induced abortion (34.7) were significantly higher than in the population. The risk associated with birth was higher among teenagers and that associated with abortion was increased in all age groups. Women who had committed a suicide tended to come from lower social classes and were more Likely to be unmarried than other women who had had a completed pregnancy.
   Conclusions-The increased risk of suicide after an induced abortion indicates either common risk factors for both or harmful effects of induced abortion on mental health.

TI  - Mercy Procedure or a Nightmare? Attitude towards Pregnancy Termination among Polish University Students
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Worldwide, there are about 121 million unintended pregnancies per year. The aim of the study was to assess the attitudes in different groups of students from 40 Polish universities towards pregnancy termination. In total, 9686 university students (20.1% male and 79.9% female) took part in our research. Questions about attitudes towards abortion in all possible circumstances were involved in the survey, which also included a socio-demographic questionnaire. Overall, 94.5% of women and 90.7% of men consider that abortion should be legal in the situation of a threat to the mother's life, while only 52% of women and 38.7% of men accept it in the case of a hard financial situation for the mother. Most students stand for abortion in the situation of a threat to the mother's life, in the case of rape, or in the case of a mortal fetus defect. Less than half of the students interviewed consider that abortion should be legal in the case of a hard financial situation for the mother or on the mother's demand. People who declare a religious affiliation more often disagree with abortion, even in the hardest cases such as a danger to the mother's life or a mortal fetus defect. The factor that influences the strongest on attitudes towards abortion is being an active Roman Catholic. The majority of students have a pro-choice attitude in respect of pregnancy termination.

TI  - Racial/ethnic and educational inequities in restrictive abortion policy variation and adverse birth outcomes in the United States
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background To examine racial/ethnic and educational inequities in the relationship between state-level restrictive abortion policies and adverse birth outcomes from 2005 to 2015 in the United States. Methods Using a state-level abortion restrictiveness index comprised of 18 restrictive abortion policies, we conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis examining whether race/ethnicity and education level moderated the relationship between the restrictiveness index and individual-level probabilities of preterm birth (PTB) and low birthweight (LBW). Data were obtained from the 2005-2015 National Center for Health Statistics Period Linked Live Birth-Infant Death Files and analyzed with linear probability models adjusted for individual- and state-level characteristics and state and year fixed-effects. Results Among 2,250,000 live births, 269,253 (12.0%) were PTBs and 182,960 (8.1%) were LBW. On average, states had approximately seven restrictive abortion policies enacted from 2005 to 2015. Black individuals experienced increased probability of PTB with additional exposure to restrictive abortion policies compared to non-Black individuals. Similarly, those with less than a college degree experienced increased probability of LBW with additional exposure to restrictive abortion policies compared to college graduates. For all analyses, inequities worsened as state environments grew increasingly restrictive. Conclusion Findings demonstrate that Black individuals at all educational levels and those with fewer years of education disproportionately experienced adverse birth outcomes associated with restrictive abortion policies. Restrictive abortion policies may compound existing racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and intersecting racial/ethnic and socioeconomic perinatal and infant health inequities.

TI  - Health needs of women victims of sexual violence in search for legal abortion
T2  - REVISTA LATINO-AMERICANA DE ENFERMAGEM
AB  - Objective: to understand the health needs that emerge on the path followed toward legal abortion by women who have suffered sexual violence. Method: an exploratory, descriptive and qualitative study, whose theoretical framework was the conceptual field of Collective Health, based on the Marxian conception of needs. The study participants were ten women who requested legal abortion at a reference service located in Sao Paulo. A semi-structured interview script was used for data collection. The data were submitted to content analysis with the support of the WebQDA software. The analytical categories used were health needs and gender. Results: despite the fact that abortion was identified as a primary need, the data revealed other needs felt by women, related to the health-disease process and with an emphasis on mental health, work, financial situation, the exercise of motherhood, access to information, autonomy, sisterhood and welcoming in the health services. Conclusion: the properly human needs were in greater evidence in the study, surpassing merely biological needs. The results point to the importance of co-responsibility of the health services with women, aiming to minimize vulnerabilities and to effectively implement reproductive rights.

TI  - Mixed messages: Implications or conflict and social support within close relationships for adjustment to a stressful life
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The authors examined the impact of women's perceptions of negative (conflict) and positive (support) exchanges with their mothers, partners, and friends before having an abortion on negative (distress) and positive (well-being) indexes of adjustment after the abortion. Preabortion conflict and support from the partner predicted postabortion adjustment in the same affective domain: Conflict uniquely predicted distress, whereas support uniquely predicted well-being. Within-source interactions were observed between support and conflict from mothers and friends. Women who perceived high support from their mothers or friends were more distressed if they also perceived them as sources of high conflict than if they perceived them as sources of low conflict. Among women who perceived their mothers or friends as nonsupportive, no relationship was observed between conflict and distress. Cross-source buffering was not observed.

TI  - Conduct disorder symptoms and subsequent pregnancy, child-birth and abortion: A population-based longitudinal study of adolescents
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENCE
AB  - Research on teenage pregnancy and abortion has primarily focused on socio-economic disadvantage. However, a few studies suggest that risk of unwanted pregnancy is related to conduct disorder symptoms. We examined the relationship between level of conduct disorder symptoms at age 15 and subsequent pregnancy, child-birth and abortion. A population-based, representative sample of Norwegian adolescent girls (N = 769) was followed from early adolescence until their mid-20s. Even with control for socio-demographic and family variables, conduct disorder symptoms at age 15 were strongly associated with pregnancy in the 15-19 age group, and a weaker association persisted in the 20-28 age group. Similar results were obtained for abortions, but here a strong relationship with conduct disorder symptoms was found even after age 20. After adjustment, no significant association between conduct disorder symptoms and subsequent child-birth was observed. More targeted preventive programmes aimed at girls with conduct disorder symptoms may be warranted. (C) 2010 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Abortion law in Muslim-majority countries: an overview of the Islamic discourse with policy implications
T2  - HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB  - Religion plays a significant role in a patient's bioethical decision to have an abortion as well as in a country's abortion policy. Nevertheless, a holistic understanding of the Islamic position remains under-researched. This study first conducted a detailed and systematic analysis of Islam's position towards abortion through examining the most authoritative biblical texts (i.e. the Quran and Sunnah) as well as other informative factors (i.e. contemporary fatwas, Islamic mysticism and broader Islamic principles, interest groups, and transnational Islamic organizations). Although Islamic jurisprudence does not encourage abortion, there is no direct biblical prohibition. Positions on abortion are notably variable, and many religious scholars permit abortion in particular circumstances during specific stages of gestational development. It is generally agreed that the least blameworthy abortion is when the life of the pregnant woman is threatened and when 120 days have not lapsed; however, there is remarkable heterogeneity in regards to other circumstances (e. g. preserving physical or mental health, foetal impairment, rape, or social or economic reasons), and later gestational development of the foetus.
   This study secondly conducted a cross-country examination of abortion rights in Muslim-majority countries. A predominantly conservative approach was found whereby 18 of 47 countries do not allow abortion under any circumstances besides saving the life of the pregnant woman. Nevertheless, there was substantial diversity between countries, and 10 countries allowed abortion 'on request'.
   Discursive elements that may enable policy development in Muslim-majority countries as well as future research that may enhance the study of abortion rights are discussed. Particularly, more lenient abortion laws may be achieved through disabusing individuals that the most authoritative texts unambiguously oppose abortion, highlighting more lenient interpretations that exist in certain Islamic legal schools, emphasizing significant actors that support abortion, and being mindful of policy frames that will not be well-received in Muslim-majority countries.

TI  - Anxiety and quality of life after first-trimester termination of pregnancy: a prospective study
T2  - ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Introduction. Possible effects of termination of pregnancy (TOP) on mental health are a matter of debate. Material and methods. We assessed anxiety and quality of life during a one-year follow up after first-trimester TOP using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Scale and EuroQoL Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D, EQ-VAS) in 742 women participating in a randomized controlled trial on early provision of intrauterine contraception. The measurements were performed before TOP, at 3 months and 1 year after TOP. Inclusion criteria were age >= 18 years, residence in Helsinki, duration of gestation <12 weeks, non-medical indication for TOP, and approval of intrauterine contraception. The trial was registered with Clinical Trials [ NCT01223521]. Results. When compared with baseline, the overall anxiety level was significantly lower and quality of life higher at 3 months and at 1 year. Reduction of anxiety and improvement of quality of life was especially evident (p < 0.001) in the 58% of women reporting clinically relevant anxiety at baseline. High levels of anxiety at baseline, history of psychiatric morbidity and smoking predicted significantly greater risk of poorer quality of life and elevated level of anxiety during the follow up. Conclusions. TOP is associated with a significant overall reduction of anxiety and an improvement of quality of life among women undergoing it for non-medical indications. High baseline anxiety, history of psychiatric morbidity and smoking are risk factors of persistently high levels of anxiety and poor quality of life after an induced abortion. These data are important when designing and providing post-abortion care.

TI  - The Legal Status of Abortion in the States if Roe v. Wade is Overruled
T2  - ISSUES IN LAW & MEDICINE
AB  - This article explores the legal status of abortion in the States if the Supreme Court overrules Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973), as modified by Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992). Although an overruling decision eventually could have a significant effect on the legal status of abortion, the immediate impact of such a decision would be far more modest than most commentators on both sides of the issue believe.
   More than two-thirds of the States have expressly repealed their pre-Roe laws or have amended those laws to conform to the trimester scheme of Roe v. Wade, which allows abortions for any reason before viability and for virtually any reason after viability. Those laws would not be revived by the overruling of Roe. Only a few of those States have enacted post-Roe laws that would prohibit most abortions if Roe were overruled. Slightly less than one-third of the States have not expressly repealed their pre-Roe laws. Many of those laws would not be effective to prohibit abortion if Roe were overruled either because they allow abortion on demand, for undefined reasons of health or for mental health reasons; because enforcement would be precluded on state constitutional grounds; or because the pre-Roe laws prohibiting abortion have been repealed by implication with the enactment of post-Roe laws regulating abortion. In sum, no more than eleven States, and very possibly as few as eight, would have laws on the books that would prohibit most abortions if Roe were overruled.

TI  - Long-term influence of unintended pregnancy on psychological distress: a large sample retrospective cross-sectional study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - This study examined the associations between childbirth decisions in women with unintended pregnancies and long-term psychological distress. An online survey of women selected from a representative research panel was conducted in July 2021. Among participants who experienced an unintended pregnancy, the childbirth decision was categorized: (i) wanted birth, (ii) abortion, (iii) adoption, and (iv) unwanted birth. Participants who made childbirth decisions more than 1 year ago were included. ANCOVA was conducted with psychological distress (Kessler 6) as the dependent variable and education, marital status, years from the decision, age of the first pregnancy, economic situation at the unintended pregnancy, and the number of persons consulted at the unintended pregnancy as covariates. Logistic regression analysis was conducted for high distress (K6 >= 13) by adjusting the same covariates. A total of 47,401 respondents participated in the study. Women with an experience of unintended pregnancy experienced more than 1 year before the study were analyzed (n = 7162). Psychological distress was the lowest for wanted birth and increased for abortion, adoption, and unwanted birth. In the adjusted model, abortion was associated with lower distress scores than both adoption and unwanted birth. Compared to the wanted birth, adoption and unwanted birth showed significantly higher levels of distress (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.03 [95% CI 1.36-3.04], aOR = 1.64 [95% CI 1.04-2.58], respectively). Long-term effects on psychological distress differed according to the childbirth decisions in unintended pregnancy. Healthcare professionals should be aware of this hidden effect of unintended pregnancy experience on women's mental health.

TI  - Psychosocial interventions targeting mental health in pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents: a systematic review
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Background Pregnancy and parenthood are known to be high-risk times for mental health. However, less is known about the mental health of pregnant adolescents or adolescent parents. Despite the substantial literature on the risks associated with adolescent pregnancy, there is limited evidence on best practices for preventing poor mental health in this vulnerable group. This systematic review therefore aimed to identify whether psychosocial interventions can effectively promote positive mental health and prevent mental health conditions in pregnant and parenting adolescents. Methods We used the standardized systematic review methodology based on the process outlined in the World Health Organization's Handbook for Guidelines Development. This review focused on randomized controlled trials of preventive psychosocial interventions to promote the mental health of pregnant and parenting adolescents, as compared to treatment as usual. We searched PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, ERIC, EMBASE and ASSIA databases, as well as reference lists of relevant articles, grey literature, and consultation with experts in the field. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence. Results We included 17 eligible studies (n = 3245 participants). Interventions had small to moderate, beneficial effects on positive mental health (SMD = 0.35, very low quality evidence), and moderate beneficial effects on school attendance (SMD = 0.64, high quality evidence). There was limited evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions on mental health disorders including depression and anxiety, substance use, risky sexual and reproductive health behaviors, adherence to antenatal and postnatal care, and parenting skills. There were no available data for outcomes on self-harm and suicide; aggressive, disruptive, and oppositional behaviors; or exposure to intimate partner violence. Only two studies included adolescent fathers. No studies were based in low- or middle-income countries. Conclusion Despite the encouraging findings in terms of effects on positive mental health and school attendance outcomes, there is a critical evidence gap related to the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for improving mental health, preventing disorders, self-harm, and other risk behaviors among pregnant and parenting adolescents. There is an urgent need to adapt and design new psychosocial interventions that can be pilot-tested and scaled with pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents and their extended networks, particularly in low-income settings.

TI  - Expectant management versus surgical evacuation in first trimester miscarriage: health-related quality of life in randomized and non-randomized patients
T2  - HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expectant management, although less effective, is an alternative treatment option for surgical evacuation in women with a miscarriage. We assessed health-related quality of life (HRQL) differences over time between expectant and surgical management in women with a miscarriage. METHODS: Women with a miscarriage were randomized to either expectant (n = 64) or surgical (n = 58) management, and 305 eligible women who refused randomization because of a preference for either treatment option were managed according to their choice following the same clinical protocol (126 expectant, 179 surgical). The main outcome measures were score differences of HRQL during 12 weeks. Repeated measures analysis was applied. RESULTS: Out of a total of 427 women, 198 were excluded in the questionnaire follow-up, leaving 229 women who participated. Mental health of women allocated to expectant management improved more and earlier (treatment effect) than of women allocated to surgical evacuation. Mental health scores were significantly better in women who chose, rather than women who were randomized, to curettage. The groups managed according to their own preference showed no differences in mental health scores. CONCLUSION: Women with a miscarriage who chose their own treatment had the best HRQL over time, supporting the role of free choice from a clinical point of view. Women without a treatment preference should be encouraged to start with expectant management for psychological reasons.

TI  - Induced First-Trimester Abortion and Risk of Mental Disorder
T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB  - BACKGROUND
   Concern has been expressed about potential harm to women's mental health in association with having an induced abortion, but it remains unclear whether induced abortion is associated with an increased risk of subsequent psychiatric problems.
   METHODS
   We conducted a population-based cohort study that involved linking information from the Danish Civil Registration system to the Danish Psychiatric Central Register and the Danish National Register of Patients. The information consisted of data for girls and women with no record of mental disorders during the 1995-2007 period who had a first-trimester induced abortion or a first childbirth during that period. We estimated the rates of first-time psychiatric contact (an inpatient admission or outpatient visit) for any type of mental disorder within the 12 months after the abortion or childbirth as compared with the 9-month period preceding the event.
   RESULTS
   The incidence rates of first psychiatric contact per 1000 person-years among girls and women who had a first abortion were 14.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.7 to 15.6) before abortion and 15.2 (95% CI, 14.4 to 16.1) after abortion. The corresponding rates among girls and women who had a first childbirth were 3.9 (95% CI, 3.7 to 4.2) before delivery and 6.7 (95% CI, 6.4 to 7.0) post partum. The relative risk of a psychiatric contact did not differ significantly after abortion as compared with before abortion (P=0.19) but did increase after childbirth as compared with before childbirth (P<0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS
   The finding that the incidence rate of psychiatric contact was similar before and after a first-trimester abortion does not support the hypothesis that there is an increased risk of mental disorders after a first-trimester induced abortion.

TI  - Elevated non-essential metals and the disordered metabolism of essential metals are associated to abnormal pregnancy with spontaneous abortion
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Spontaneous abortion is a considerable threat to the physiology and mental health of the mother. The etiology of spontaneous abortion is multifactorial with complicated mechanisms, of which overexposure to non-essential metals (especially heavy metals) has been proposed to be associated with adverse birth outcomes. However, significant knowledge gaps remain to be filled in, such as the deleterious profile of non-essential metals and their interplay with essential metals in abnormal pregnancy. Under this setting, we aimed to address these challenges by conducting a cross-sectional study on 56 patients with spontaneous abortion in the 1st trimester, by comparing to 55 healthy pregnant women in 1st the trimester and 41 non-pregnant healthy women. Overexposure to a few non-essential metals, such as arsenic (As), antimony (Sb) and bismuth (Bi), was found in patients with spontaneous abortion, and likewise, some essential elements, such as magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), vanadium (V), strontium (Sr) and tin (Sn), were also found to be elevated under spontaneous abortion. Further evidence of abnormal pregnancy was induced by a reduced level of internal hormones necessary for normal gestation, such as estradiol (E2) and progesterone (PRGE) in women with spontaneous abortion. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were slightly increased in patients with spontaneous abortion. Comprehensive correlation analyses were carried out to identify the crucial factors that result in abortion. Our data stratified the important variables in decreasing order: PRGE, As, Mg, Sb, Sr, Sn, Bi and pregnant times in the progress of spontaneous abortion. Moreover, labyrinthine associations were uncovered between PRGE, nonessential metals and essential elements in causing spontaneous abortion. Therefore, our combined data unveiled the likely synergistic implications of elevated non-essential metals and the disordered metabolism of essential metals in abnormal pregnancy.

TI  - Does abortion increase women's risk for post-traumatic stress? Findings from a prospective longitudinal cohort study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective: To prospectively assess women's risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and of experiencing post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) over 4 years after seeking an abortion, and to assess whether symptoms are attributed to the pregnancy, abortion or birth, or other events in women's lives.
   Design: Prospective longitudinal cohort study which followed women from approximately 1 week after receiving or being denied an abortion (baseline), then every 6 months for 4 years (9 interview waves).
   Setting: 30 abortion facilities located throughout the USA.
   Participants: Among 956 women presenting for abortion care, some of whom received an abortion and some of whom were denied due to advanced gestational age; 863 women are included in the longitudinal analyses.
   Main outcome measures: PTSS and PTSD risk were measured using the Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD). Index pregnancy-related PTSS was measured by coding the event(s) described by women as the cause of their symptoms.
   Analyses: We used unadjusted and adjusted logistic mixed-effects regression analyses to assess whether PTSS, PTSD risk and pregnancy-related PTSS trajectories of women obtaining abortions differed from those who were denied one.
   Results: At baseline, 39% of participants reported any PTSS and 16% reported three or more symptoms. Among women with symptoms 1-week post-abortion seeking (n=338), 30% said their symptoms were due to experiences of sexual, physical or emotional abuse or violence; 20% attributed their symptoms to non-violent relationship issues; and 19% said they were due to the index pregnancy. Baseline levels of PTSS, PTSD risk and pregnancy-related PTSS outcomes did not differ significantly between women who received and women who were denied an abortion. PTSS, PTSD risk and pregnancy-related PTSS declined over time for all study groups.
   Conclusions: Women who received an abortion were at no higher risk of PTSD than women denied an abortion.

TI  - Pregnancy loss and anxiety and depression during subsequent pregnancies: data from the C-ABC study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Previous studies have shown that pregnancy loss may affect the mental health of women in subsequent pregnancies. The China Anhui Birth Defects and Child Development cohort study therefore aimed to investigate the influence of pregnancy loss on anxiety and depression in subsequent pregnancies.
   Study design: In total, 20,308 pregnant women provided written informed consent and completed the study questionnaire. The Self-rating Anxiety Scale and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale were used to evaluate anxiety and depression in pregnant women. Pearson's chi(2) test and binary logistic regression were used for statistical analyses.
   Results: Of 20,308 pregnant women, 1495 (7.36%) had a history of miscarriage and 7686 (37.85%) had a history of induced abortion. The binary logistic regression model found that pregnant women with a history of miscarriage had a significantly higher risk of anxiety and depression in the first trimester than primigravidae after stratified analysis according to the timing of the first prenatal visit (p < 0.05). Compared with pregnant women with no history of miscarriage, women who had a history of miscarriage and an interpregnancy interval of less than 6 months had increased risk of anxiety symptoms (p < 0.05) and depression symptoms (p < 0.05) during the first trimester. Women with an interpregnancy interval of 7-12 months had a 2.511-fold higher risk of depression (p < 0.05) than women with no history of miscarriage. These findings were not changed after adjustment for maternal age, maternal education, family income, place of residence and pre-pregnancy body mass index.
   Conclusions: Women with a history of miscarriage experienced significant anxiety and depression during their next pregnancy. A short interpregnancy interval and the first trimester are risk factors for adverse mental health. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Induced abortion has no psychological effect on early parental self-efficacy and psychological well-being: The Steps to the Healthy Development and Well-being of Children study
T2  - ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Introduction An association between a history of induced abortion and psychological well-being post-abortion has been demonstrated in recently published studies, which is contrary to the findings of existing known high-quality studies. Material and methods An evaluation was conducted to determine whether a history of abortion affected the psychological well-being and parental self-efficacy of first-time mothers and their partners; this assessment was performed when the child was aged 18 months. Questionnaires were administered to 492 first-time mothers, 37 of whom had a history of abortion, and their partners (n = 436). Women with previous miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, and deliveries were excluded. The women were allocated to an abortion group or a comparison group, depending on each woman's abortion history obtained from medical birth registry data. Psychological well-being, which encompassed social and emotional loneliness, marital satisfaction, social phobia, and depression, was evaluated as a predictor of maternal and paternal self-efficacy within the two groups. The analysis was conducted using multi-group structural equation modeling. Results Induced abortion was not predictive of maternal or paternal well-being or parental self-efficacy. Overall, maternal and paternal psychological well-being was predictive of parental self-efficacy when an assessment was performed, regardless of an abortion history. After testing the invariance of multi-group models, psychological well-being was similarly found to predict parental self-efficacy in both the abortion history and comparison groups. Conclusions These findings suggest that the psychological well-being of parents is an important predictor of maternal and paternal self-efficacy during toddlerhood. Abortion history was not demonstrated to negatively impact the psychological well-being of parents with respect to their capacity for parental self-efficacy.

TI  - The role of community and culture in abortion perceptions, decisions, and experiences among Asian Americans
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - IntroductionCulture and community can play a role in views, stigma, and access related to abortion. No research to date has documented the influence of culture and community attitudes on Asian American (AA) experiences accessing abortion care in the United States (US). This paper aims to fill gaps in research and understand how cultural and community views influence medication abortion access and experiences among AAs. MethodsWe used a community-based participatory research approach, which included collaboration among experts in public health, advocates, practitioners, and community partners to understand abortion knowledge, attitudes, and experiences among AAs. Using a semi-structured interview guide, we interviewed twenty-nine eligible people of reproductive age over 18 that self-identified as Asian American or mixed race including Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and/or Pacific Islander (AANHPI), and had a medication abortion in the US between January 2016 and March 2021. Interviews were analyzed and coded in NVivo 12 using a modified grounded theory approach. ResultsParticipants described various influences of religion negatively impacting acceptability of abortion among their family and community. Lack of openness around sexual and reproductive health (SRH) topics contributed to stigma and influenced most participants' decision not to disclose their abortion to family members, which resulted in participants feeling isolated throughout their abortion experience. When seeking abortion care, participants preferred to seek care with providers of color, especially if they were AANHPI due to past experiences involving stigma and judgment from White providers. Based on their experiences, respondents recommended ways to improve the abortion experience for AAs in the US including, (1) more culturally aware abortion providers from one's community who better understand their needs; (2) clinics providing abortion services located in or near AA communities with signage in local languages; and (3) tailored mental health resources with culturally aware therapists. ConclusionThis study demonstrates ways in which culture and community opinions toward SRH can influence both the acceptability of abortion and experiences seeking abortion care among AAs. It is important to consider family and community dynamics among AAs to better tailor services and meet the needs of AAs seeking abortion care in the US.

TI  - Childbirth, abortion and subsequent substance use in young women: a population-based longitudinal study
T2  - ADDICTION
AB  - Aims To investigate the possible linkages between deliveries, abortions and subsequent nicotine dependence, alcohol problems and use of cannabis and other illegal drugs from the ages of 15-27 years. Methods Data were gathered as part of the Young in Norway Longitudinal Study, an 11-year follow-up of a representative sample of Norwegian adolescents and young adults. Design, setting and participants Information was obtained on (i) the history of childbirths and induced abortions for the participants between the ages of 15-27 years; (ii) measures of nicotine dependence, alcohol problems and use of cannabis and other illegal drugs; and (iii) socio-demographic, family and individual confounding factors. Results Those who had had an abortion had elevated rates of substance use and problems. Those who gave birth to a child had reduced rates of alcohol problems and cannabis use. These associations persisted after control for confounders. However, those women who still lived with the father of the aborted fetus were not at increased risk. Conclusions Abortion in women may, under some circumstances, be associated with increased risk of nicotine dependence, alcohol problems and use of cannabis and other illegal drugs. The birth of a child may reduce the use of some substances.

TI  - Nonpharmacological interventions to improve the psychological well-being of women accessing abortion services and their satisfaction with care: A systematic review
T2  - NURSING & HEALTH SCIENCES
AB  - How women perceive and experience abortion impacts their subsequent psychological well-being. This systematic review evaluated nonpharmacological interventions designed to support women undergoing abortion services and improve their psychological well-being and satisfaction with care. Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Sociological s, Social Services s, and PTSD Pubs. All searches were limited to peer-reviewed articles published in English from January 2010 to February 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility. Ten studies were included, involving four types of interventions: music therapy; social support; information support; and mandated waiting and counseling requirements on abortion access. Outcome measures were divided into four categories comprised of cognitive domains, emotional and psychological well-being, clinical symptoms, and satisfaction with care. However, there is limited evidence on intervention effects. Most studies report null or mixed intervention effects. Even though some positive effects on women's cognitive outcomes and satisfaction with care were seen, findings across studies were inconclusive. Findings also show that methodological limitations such as lack of theoretical basis, inadequate reporting and no power sample size calculation were apparent across studies. There is limited evidence about nonpharmacological interventions designed to improve women's satisfaction with abortion services or psychological outcomes subsequent to accessing abortion services. Well-designed interventions that meet the needs of service-users should be developed and rigorously tested.

TI  - Incidence and recurrence of common mental disorders after abortion: Results from a prospective cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - Research in the field of mental health consequences of abortion is characterized by methodological limitations. We used exact matching on carefully selected confounders in a prospective cohort study of 325 women who had an abortion of an unwanted pregnancy and compared them 1-to-1 to controls who did not have this experience. Outcome measures were incidence and recurrence of common DSM-IV mental disorders (mood, anxiety, substance use disorders, and the aggregate measure 'any mental disorder') as measured with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) version 3.0, in the 2.5-3 years after the abortion. Although non-matched data suggested otherwise, women in the abortion group did not show significantly higher odds for incidence of 'any mental disorder', or mood, anxiety and substance use disorders, compared to matched controls who were similar in background variables but did not have an this experience. Having an abortion did not increase the odds for recurrence of the three disorder categories, but for any mental disorder the higher odds in the abortion group remained significant after matching. It is unlikely that termination of an unwanted pregnancy increases the risk on incidence of common mental disorders in women without a psychiatric history. However, it might increase the risk of recurrence among women with a history of mental disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Self-esteem, mental health and the sexualization of repression: The United States at the turn of the century
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SEXUALFORSCHUNG
AB  - For over a decade the sexual-political discourse in the United States has been increasingly influenced by the Religious Right. The campaigns against abortion and homosexuality and for sexual abstinence before marriage have been effective in determining policy and funding with regard to public health, sex education, and scientific research. The restrictive moral teaching of the Religious Right is also being exported to the Third World in the redirection of HIV prevention programs away from condoms and toward abstinence messages. However, the Christian conservatives today seldom use religious arguments in public debates, but rather advance their cause on secular grounds. Repression is packaged as promotion of self-esteem and mental health, but it is also highly sexualised. Those who conform are promised a more intensive, blissful and satisfying sexual life, while the misery besetting many marriages is also described in graphic and sexually explicit detail. The public success of the Christian conservatives in the US demonstrates that the concept of sexual rights as human rights has far less support in American society than in many European countries.

TI  - Five-Year Suicidal Ideation Trajectories Among Women Receiving or Being Denied an Abortion
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of receiving compared with being denied an abortion on women's experiences of suicidal ideation over 5 years.
   Method: The authors recruited 956 women from 30 U.S. abortion facilities. Women were interviewed by telephone 1 week after their abortion visit, then every 6 months for 5 years. Women who received near-limit abortions were compared with women who were denied an abortion and carried their pregnancies to term (turnaway-birth group). Women completed the suicidal ideation items on the Brief Symptom Interview (BSI) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale was used to assess imminent suicidality. Adjusted mixed-effects regression analyses accounting for clustering by site and individual were used to assess whether levels and trajectories of suicidality differed by group.
   Results: One week after abortion seeking, 1.9% of the near-limit group and 1.3% of the turnaway-birth group reported any suicidal ideation symptoms on the BSI. Over the 5-year study period, the proportion of women with any suicidal ideation symptoms on the BSI declined significantly to 0.25% for women in the near-limit group and non-significantly to 0.21% for those in the turnaway-birth group. In four out of 7,247 observations (0.06%), women reported being imminently suicidal. There was no statistically significant differential toss to follow-up by baseline report of suicidal ideation or history of depression or anxiety. There were no statistically significant group differences on any suicidal ideation outcome over the 5-year study period.
   Conclusions: Levels of suicidal ideation were similarly tow between women who had abortions and women who were denied abortions. Policies requiring that women be warned that they are at increased risk of becoming suicidal if they choose abortion are not evidence based.

TI  - Clinical Applications of Telemedicine in Gynecology and Women's Health
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB  - Telemedicine and telehealth (TM/TH) are the 2 terms used interchangeably focusing on the delivery of health care services at a long distance using telecommunication technology. TM/TH has several gynecologic applications, including the well-woman visits, preventive care, preconception counseling, family planning including contraception and medical abortion, infertility workup, teleradiology, cervical cancer screening and colposcopy, mental health, and telesurgery. The goals of TM/TH are not only improving quality of health care in patients and building a virtual community of physicians but also increasing convenience, efficacy, and decreasing medical cost. In gynecology, TM/TH plays an important role, especially in well-woman care.

TI  - Born unwanted - Observations from the Prague study
T2  - AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
AB  - The authors followed 220 children born in 1961-1963 to women twice denied abortion for the same pregnancy in Prague (Czech Republic) and 220 pair-matched controls, whose mothers were pair-matched for age and socioeconomic status and the partner's presence in the home. They were medically, psychologically, and socially assessed at ages 9, 14-16, 21-23, 30, and 35. Although differences in psychosocial development between the unwanted study participants and pair-matched controls were not dramatic and changed over time, the differences were consistently in disfavor of the unwanted pregnancy participants. When siblings were used as controls, the findings supported the hypothesis that being born from an unwanted pregnancy is a risk factor for poor mental health in adulthood.

TI  - Provision of long-acting reversible contraception at surgical abortion-A cross-sectional nationwide register study
T2  - ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Introduction Provision of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) at surgical abortion is safe, practical, and leads to higher user rates than does delayed provision. The aim of this study was to explore whether provision of LARC at surgical abortion is associated with known risk factors for subsequent abortions and inconsistent use of contraception, including sociodemographic factors and psychiatric disorders. Material and Methods This was a register-based cross-sectional study of 6251 women having a surgical abortion in Sweden. Data were collected from National health and population registers. Women with procedure codes for surgical abortion were identified in the National Patient Register from October 2016 to December 2018. Information from Statistics Sweden, the National Patient Register, and the Swedish prescribed drug register on sociodemographic factors, psychiatric disorders, and dispensed LARC was added and linked on an individual level. Associations of sociodemographic factors and psychiatric disorders with LARC provision were explored with generalized logit mixed models and presented as crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The overall rate of LARC provision at the time of the abortion was 2515/6251 (40.2%). Younger age and lower level of education were associated with an increased likelihood of LARC provision. In the study population, 2624/6251 (42.0%) patients had a pre- or post-abortion psychiatric disorder, a factor associated with an increased likelihood of LARC provision compared with women with no such disorders (adjusted odds ratio 1.21; 95% CI 1.08-1.34). The highest rates and odds were seen among women with personality, substance use, and/or neurodevelopmental disorders and among women with multiple psychiatric disorders. Conclusions Sociodemographic risk factors and psychiatric disorders were associated with increased LARC provision at surgical abortion, indicating that women at high risk of unwanted pregnancies are provided with effective contraception. Still, less than half of all women undergoing surgical abortion were provided with LARC, suggesting that contraceptive access and counseling prior to a surgical abortion can be improved.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Healing Interventions for Post-Abortion Grief: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Abortion is the ending of pregnancy due to removing an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus. Some women suffer from psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression and grief after abortion. Early detection of high-risk women after abortion and psychological intervention is one of the healing methods than can lead to improving outcomes but its effectiveness is not clear. The present meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of this approach.
   Methods: The international and national electronic databases were searched from Jan 1998 until Aug 2018 including Medline, Web of Knowledge, Ovid, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, ScienceDirect, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Google Scholar, Iranmedex, Scientific Information Database (SID), and Magiran. The pooled mean difference with the random-effects model was used for meta-analyses. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines adhered in this study.
   Results: We enrolled 7 relevant studies involving 918 subjects into the meta-analysis process. The meta-analysis of the interventions aiming at prevention of post-abortion grief yielded a pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.03 (95% CI: -0.40-0.34; Z=0.16; P=0.87) at post-test and of -0.21 (95% CI:-0.53-0.10; Z=1.32; P=0.19) at follow-up.
   Conclusion: This systematic review found psychotherapy-based interventions are effective in post-abortion grief treatment but; we found psychotherapy-based interventions are somewhat effective in short-term post-abortion grief and it has a better effect on long-term grief.

TI  - Designing a Needs-Oriented Psychological Intervention for Chinese Women Undergoing an Abortion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Accessing good quality abortion care is a fundamental human right and contributes to achieving Sustainable Development Goals. However, well-designed abortion care that meets women's needs is limited. This study aims to systematically develop an intervention to promote the psychological well-being of Chinese women undergoing an abortion. A five-step iterative approach informed by intervention mapping was undertaken to determine the intervention design. Step 1 used in-depth interviews with 14 Chinese women undergoing an abortion to assess real-life stressors and support needs. We identified eight stressors and found women's support needs varied with the time trajectory of the abortion. Step 2 used a focus group discussion with care providers to select modifiable stressors that impact negative psychological outcomes. In Step 3 and Step 4, we determined and integrated the exact strategies to eliminate or mitigate possible modifiable stressors by incorporating information from in-depth interviews and the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping. The integrated strategies were instructional support, informational support, and timely communication. In Step 5, we composed the detailed intervention design according to the best available evidence and, to confirm content validity, consulted 10 women who had undergone abortion in the previous 2-6 weeks. The intervention was titled STress-And-coping suppoRT (START), which included four interacting components: (1) a face-to-face consultation at the first appointment; (2) a printed booklet with information on abortion, self-care, and managing emotions and intimate relationships; (3) a WeChat-based online public profile page offering the same information as the booklet; (4) a telephone hotline. This study paves the way for a new approach to addressing the psychological needs of women experiencing abortion in China. The rigorous process provides an example of developing tailored health promotion interventions.

TI  - Induced abortion among women veterans: data from the ECUUN study
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Objective: We compared rates of induced abortion among women veterans receiving Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare to rates in the general US population, as current policy prohibits VA provision of abortion counseling or services even when pregnancy endangers a veteran's life.
   Methods: We analyzed data from 2298 women veterans younger than 45 years who completed a telephone-based, cross-sectional survey of randomly sampled English-speaking women from across the United States who had received VA healthcare. We compared lifetime, last-5-year and last-year rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion among participants to age-matched data from the National Survey of Family Growth. As few abortions were reported in the last year, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between abortion in the last 5 years and age, race/ethnicity, income, education, religion, marital status, parity, geography, deployment history, housing instability, and past medical and mental health among VA patients.
   Results: Women veterans were more likely than matched US women to report ever having an abortion [17.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 16.1%-19.3% vs. 15.2% of US women]. In the last 5 years, unintended pregnancy and abortion were reported by veterans at rates similar to US women. In multivariable models, VA patients were more likely to report abortion in the last 5 years if their annual income was less than $40,000 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.95, 95% CI 1.30-6.70), they had experienced homelessness or housing instability (adjusted OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.01-3.62), they were single (adj. OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.23-4.91) and/or they had given birth (adjusted OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.19-4.40).
   Conclusion: Women veterans face unintended pregnancy and seek abortion as often as the larger US population.
   Implications: The Veterans Health Care Act, which prohibits provision of abortion services, increases vulnerable veterans' out-of-pocket healthcare costs and limits veterans' reproductive freedom. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Abortion and multifetal pregnancy reduction: An ethical comparison
T2  - ETIKK I PRAKSIS
AB  - In recent years, multifetal pregnancy reduction (MFPR) has increasingly been a subject of debate in Norway. The intensity of this debate reached a tentative maximum when the Legislation Department delivered their interpretative statement, Section 2 - Interpretation of the Abortion Act, in 2016 in response to a request from the Ministry of Health (2014) that the Legislation Department consider whether the Abortion Act allows for MFPR of healthy fetuses in multiple pregnancies. The Legislation Department concluded that the current abortion legislation [as of 2016] allows for MFPR subject to the constraints that the law otherwise stipulates. The debate has not subsided, and during autumn 2018 it was further intensified in connection with the Norwegian Christian Democratic "crossroads" policy and signals from the Conservatives to consider removing section 2.3c and to forbid MFPR.
   Many of the arguments in the MFPR debate are seemingly similar to arguments put forward in the general abortion debate, and an analysis to ascertain what distinguishes MFPR from other abortions has yet to be conducted. The aim of this article is, therefore, to examine whether there is a moral distinction between abortion and MFPR of healthy fetuses. We will cover the typical arguments emerging in the debate in Norway and exemplify them with scholarly articles from the literature. We have dubbed the most important arguments against MFPR that we have identified the harm argument, the slippery-slope argument, the intention argument, the grief argument, the long-term psychological effects for the woman argument, and the sorting argument. We conclude that these arguments do not measure up in terms of demonstrating a morally relevant difference between MFPR of healthy fetuses and other abortions. Our conclusion is, therefore - despite what several discussants seem to think - that there is no morally relevant difference between the two. Therefore, on the same conditions as we allow for abortions, we should also allow MFPR.

TI  - Subsequent Unintended Pregnancy Among US Women Who Receive or Are Denied a Wanted Abortion
T2  - JOURNAL OF MIDWIFERY & WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - IntroductionSeventeen percent of women in the United States experience more than one unintended pregnancy in their lifetimes. However, few studies examine how the resolution of unintended pregnancy, whether in birth or abortion, affects the likelihood of a subsequent unintended pregnancy. Our objective was to determine whether receiving or being denied a wanted abortion is associated with subsequent unintended pregnancy.
   MethodsThe Turnaway Study, a 5-year, prospective cohort study, followed women who sought an abortion at one of 30 abortion facilities across the United States between 2008 and 2010. Secondary analysis of the Turnaway data analyzed the effects of various factors on time to subsequent unintended pregnancy.
   ResultsBy 5 years, the rate of unintended pregnancy was 42 per 100 women with no difference between those who received and those who were denied a wanted abortion. Women aged 35 to 46 years (vs those aged 20-24 years), women with a college degree (vs women who had completed high school or obtained a general education diploma), and foreign-born (vs native-born) women had a reduced rate of a subsequent unplanned pregnancy (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.57; AHR, 0.54, 95% CI, 0.30-0.97; AHR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.77, respectively). Higher parity and a history of depression were positively associated with a higher rate of subsequent unintended pregnancy. There was no difference in the outcomes of these unintended pregnancies by study group; approximately one-sixth ended in miscarriage and one-quarter of subsequent unintended pregnancies ended in abortion.
   DiscussionNeither receiving nor being denied abortion is associated with subsequent unintended pregnancy risk. Other factors such as nativity, parity, age, and mental health history are associated with multiple unintended pregnancies. Ensuring access to abortion services will not increase the likelihood that women will experience subsequent unintended pregnancies.

TI  - Access to abortion under the heath exception: a comparative analysis in three countries
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Background: Despite Britain, Colombia, and some Mexican states sharing a health exception within their abortion laws, access to abortion under the health exception varies widely. This study examines factors that result in heterogeneous application of similar health exception laws and consequences for access to legal abortion. Our research adds to previous literature by comparing implementation of similar abortion laws across countries to identify strategies for full implementation of the health exception.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-country comparative descriptive study synthesizing data from document and literature review, official abortion statistics, and interviews with key informants. We gathered information on the use and interpretation of the health exception in the three countries from peer-reviewed literature, court documents, and grey literature. We next extracted public and private abortion statistics to understand the application of the law in each setting. We used a matrix to synthesize information and identify key factors in the use of the law. We conducted in-depth interviews with doctors and experts familiar with the health exception laws in each country and analyzed the qualitative data based on the previously identified factors.
   Results: The health exception is used broadly in Britain, somewhat in Colombia, and very rarely in Mexican states. We identified five factors as particularly salient to application of the health exception in each setting: 1) comprehensiveness of the law including explicit mention of mental health, 2) a strong public health sector that funds abortion, 3) knowledge of and attitudes toward the health exception law, including guidelines for physicians in providing abortion, 4) dissemination of information about the health exception law, and 5) a history of court cases that protect women and clarify the health exception law.
   Conclusions: The health exception is a valuable tool for expanding access to legal abortion. Differences in the use of the health exception as an indication for legal abortion result in wide access for women in Britain to nearly no access in Mexican states. Our findings highlight the difference between theoretical and real access to legal abortion. The interpretation and application of the health exception law are pivotal to expanding real access to abortion.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT LAWS ON YOUTH SUICIDE
T2  - ECONOMIC INQUIRY
AB  - Using state-level data on suicides from the period 1987 to 2003, we find that the adoption of a law requiring a parent's notification or consent before a minor can obtain an abortion is associated with an 11%21% reduction in the number of 15- through 17-year-old females who commit suicide. In contrast, the adoption of a parental involvement law is not associated with a reduction in the number of older females who commit suicide or in the number of 15- through 17-year-old males who commit suicide. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that parental involvement laws represent an increase in the expected cost of having unprotected sex, and, as a consequence, serve to protect young females from depression and what have been termed stressful life events such as conflict with a parent or an abortion.

TI  - Depression and unwanted first pregnancy: longitudinal cohort study
T2  - BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Objective To examine the outcomes of an unwanted first pregnancy (abortion v live delivery) and risk of depression and to explain discrepancies with previous research that used the same dataset.
   Design Longitudinal cohort study.
   Setting Nationally representative sample of US men and women aged 14-24 in 1979.
   Participants 1247 women in the US national longitudinal survey of youth who aborted or delivered an unwanted first pregnancy.
   Main outcome measures Clinical cut-off and continuous scores on a 1992 measure of the Center for Epidemiological Studies depression scale.
   Results Terminating compared with delivering an unwanted first pregnancy was not directly related to risk of clinically significant depression (odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.66). No evidence was found of a relation between pregnancy outcome and depression in analyses of subgroups known to vary in under-reporting of abortion. In analyses of the characteristics. of non-respondents, refusal to provide information on abortion did not explain die lack of detecting a relation between abortion and mental health. The abortion group had a significantly higher mean education and income and lower total family size, all of which were associated with a lower risk of depression.
   Conclusions Evidence that choosing to terminate rather than deliver an unwanted first pregnancy puts women at higher risk of depression is inconclusive. Discrepancies between current findings and those of previous research using die same dataset primarily reflect differences in coding of a first pregnancy.

TI  - Contraception and abortion attitudes and practices of Western Ukraine women
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTRACEPTION AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE
AB  - Objectives To assess the attitudes and practices of contraceptive behaviors of Western Ukraine women.
   Methods A survey of 500 women in the Oblast was conducted to assess their knowledge, attitudes and practices on a variety of health topics. Convenience sampling was used to access the subjects in 16 different towns/villages in nine rayons throughout the Oblast. Respondents were asked more than 100 questions pertaining to their knowledge, attitudes and practices on a variety of health topics, including stress, contraception, breast health, sexually transmitted diseases, parity, abortion, nutrition, alcohol and tobacco use, domestic violence, and depression and mental health.
   Results Of married women, 44% (112/256) would terminate their pregnancy while 56% (144/256) said they would keep their baby. Of unmarried women, 35% (31/88) would abort while 65% (57/88) would keep their baby. A large proportion of married women (82%; 222/271) and unmarried women (70%; 52/74) did not use condoms at all.
   Conclusion These results suggest lack of birth control education and contribution to poor protection from sexually transmitted infections. Higher abortion practices may also play a role in the infertility issues that Ukrainian women currently face.

TI  - Abortion and multifetal pregnancy reduction: An ethical comparison
T2  - ETIKK I PRAKSIS
AB  - During recent years, multifetal pregnancy reduction has increasingly been subject to debate in Norway, and this debate reached an apex when the Legislation Department delivered the interpretation statement 2 - Interpretation of the Abortion Act in 2016 in response to the Ministry of Health and Care Services, who had (in 2014) requested the Legislation Department to assess whether the Abortion Act allowed for multifetal pregnancy reductions of healthy fetuses. The Legislation Department concluded that the Abortion Act does regulate and permit multifetal pregnancy reductions within the framework that the law otherwise stipulates. The debate has not subsided, and in the autumn of 2018, it was further intensified in connection with the Norwegian Christian Democratic Party's (KrF) "crossroads choice" and the signals from the Norwegian Conservative Party that they would consider reverting the Abortion Act's section 2.3c [regulating second trimester abortions due to fetal anomalies], as well as a ban on multifetal pregnancy reduction.
   Many of the arguments in the multifetal pregnancy reduction debate appear very similar to the arguments pending in the general abortion debate, and an analysis of what makes multifetal pregnancy reduction significantly different from abortion is wanting. The aim of this article is, accordingly, to investigate to what extent there is a morally relevant distinction between abortion and multifetal pregnancy reduction of healthy fetuses. We take on board typical arguments from the Norwegian debate and consider them in light of the scholarly literature. We have identified the most central arguments against multifetal pregnancy reduction as the harm argument, the slippery slope argument, the intent argument, the grief argument, the regret argument (concerning long-term psychological effects for the woman), and the sorting argument. We argue that these counter-arguments do not succeed in establishing a morally relevant difference between abortion and multifetal pregnancy reduction of healthy fetuses. Our conclusion is, therefore that despite what is often held - there is no morally significant difference between the two. Therefore, when we allow abortion, we should also allow multifetal pregnancy reductions.

TI  - Effects of Pregnancy Loss on Subsequent Postpartum Mental Health: A Prospective Longitudinal Cohort Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Pregnancy loss, natural or induced, is linked to higher rates of mental health problems, but little is known about its effects during the postpartum period. This study identifies the percentages of women receiving at least one postpartum psychiatric treatment (PPT), defined as any psychiatric treatment (ICD-9 290-316) within six months of their first live birth, relative to their history of pregnancy loss, history of prior mental health treatments, age, and race. The population consists of young women eligible for Medicaid in states that covered all reproductive services between 1999-2012. Of 1,939,078 Medicaid beneficiaries with a first live birth, 207,654 (10.7%) experienced at least one PPT, and 216,828 (11.2%) had at least one prior pregnancy loss. A history of prior mental health treatments (MHTs) was the strongest predictor of PPT, but a history of pregnancy loss is also another important risk factor. Overall, women with a prior pregnancy loss were 35% more likely to require a PPT. When the interactions of prior mental health and prior pregnancy loss are examined in greater detail, important effects of these combinations were revealed. About 58% of those whose first MHT was after a pregnancy loss required PPT. In addition, over 99% of women with a history of MHT one year prior to their first pregnancy loss required PPT after their first live births. These findings reveal that pregnancy loss (natural or induced) is a risk factor for PPT, and that the timing of events and the time span for considering prior mental health in research on pregnancy loss can significantly change observed effects. Clinicians should screen for a convergence of a history of MHT and prior pregnancy loss when evaluating pregnant women, in order to make appropriate referrals for counseling.

TI  - Pathways to adverse pregnancy outcomes: exploring the mediating role of intimate partner violence and depression: results from a South African rape cohort study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) are common occurrences that contribute to negative maternal and child health outcomes. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that trauma exposure and depression are drivers of the better-recognised risk factors for miscarriage, abortion and stillbirths. Our comparative cohort study based in Durban, South Africa recruited women who reported a recent rape (n = 852) and those who had never experienced rape (n = 853), with follow-up for 36 months. We explored APOs (miscarriage, abortion or stillbirth) among those having a pregnancy during follow-up (n = 453). Potential mediators were baseline depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, substance abuse, HbA1C, BMI, hypertension and smoking. A structural equation model (SEM) was used to determine direct and indirect paths to APO. Overall, 26.6% of the women had a pregnancy in the follow-up period and 29.4% ended in an APO, with miscarriage (19.9%) the most common outcome, followed by abortion (6.6%) and stillbirths (2.9%). The SEM showed two direct pathways from exposure to childhood trauma, rape and other trauma, to APO which were ultimately mediated by hypertension and/or BMI, but all paths to BMI were mediated by depression and IPV-mediated pathways from childhood and other trauma to hypertension. Food insecurity mediated a pathway from experiences of trauma in childhood to depression. Our study confirms the important role of trauma exposure, including rape, and depression on APOs, through their impact on hypertension and BMI. It is critical that violence against women and mental health are more systematically addressed in antenatal, pregnancy and postnatal care.

TI  - Depression, emotional and social aspects in the abortion context: a comparison between two Brazilian capitals
T2  - REVISTA DA ASSOCIACAO MEDICA BRASILEIRA
AB  - Depression, emotional and social aspects in the abortion context: a comparison between two Brazilian capitals
   Objective: To assess emotional and social aspects in the experience of abortion and the diagnosis of major depression, comparing women from two Brazilian cities (Sao Paulo - SP, Natal - RN). Methods: A transversal study was carried out from January 2009 to May 2010, through semi-directed interviews with women undergoing an abortion (up to 22 weeks gestation) treated at university hospitals in Sao Paulo - SP (n = 166) and Natal - RN (n = 150). The Portuguese version of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) instrument was applied for the diagnosis of depression. Results: There was no significant difference (p = 0.223) in the proportion of induced abortions when comparing the two capital cities: Natal (7.3%) and Sao Paulo (12.0%). The diagnosis of depression was high among women undergoing an abortion and was significantly higher in Natal than in Sao Paulo (50.7% vs. 32.5%, p < 0.01). Regarding emotional aspects, there was no difference in the occurrence of guilt feelings (Natal 27.7%; Sao Paulo 23.3%; p = 0.447). The partner's involvement was considered satisfactory by women in similar proportions in the two capitals (Natal 62.0%; Sao Paulo 59.0%, p = 0.576). No difference was found in the proportion of women who reported violence, related or not to the abortion (Natal 22.9%; Sao Paulo 16.6%; p = 0.378). Conclusion: Although there was no difference between the emotional and social aspects in the comparison between the two capitals, there was a high proportion of women with major depression, more frequent in the city of Natal than in Sao Paulo, which demonstrates the importance of psychosocial support in the women's healthcare system.

TI  - PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE OF SPONTANEOUS OR ELECTIVE ABORTION AND RISK FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS AND DEPRESSION DURING SUBSEQUENT PREGNANCY
T2  - DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY
AB  - Background: Few studies have considered whether elective and/or spontaneous abortion (EAB/SAB) may be risk factors for mental health sequelae in subsequent pregnancy. This paper examines the impact of EAB/SAB on mental health during subsequent pregnancy in a sample of women involved in a larger prospective study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the childbearing year (n = 1,581). Methods: Women expecting their first baby completed standardized telephone assessments including demographics, trauma history, PTSD, depression, and pregnancy wantedness, and religiosity. Results: Fourteen percent (n = 221) experienced a prior elective abortion (EAB), 13.1% (n = 206) experienced a prior spontaneous abortion (SAB), and 1.4% (n = 22) experienced both. Of those women who experienced either an EAB or SAB, 13.9% (n = 220) appraised the FAR or SAB experience as having been "a hard time" (i.e., potentially traumatic) and 32.6% (n = 132) rated it as their index trauma (i.e., their worst or second worst lifetime exposure). Among the subset of 405 women with prior EAB or SAB, the rate of PTSD during the subsequent pregnancy was 12.6% (n-51), the rate of depression was 16.8% (n = 68), and 5.4% (n-22) met criteria for both disorders. Conclusions: History of sexual trauma predicted appraising the experience of EAB or SAB as "a hard time." Wanting to be pregnant sooner was predictive of appraising the experience of EAB or SAB as the worst or second worst (index) trauma. EAR or SAB was appraised as less traumatic than sexual or medical trauma exposures and conveyed relatively lower risk for PTSD. The patterns of predictors for depression were similar.

TI  - Being born female is dangerous for your health
T2  - AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
AB  - In this article, the author explores how gender inequity is manifested in poor reproductive and mental health outcomes, including unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion, maternal mortality, sexually transmitted infections, depression, and psychosomatic symptoms. Briefly described is a landmark 1994 United Nations conference emphasizing that gender inequity adversely affects women's reproductive health, particularly in developing countries, and the implementation of its recommendations is tracked. Although there is increased recognition of oppression's toll on women's physical and emotional health as well as their intellectual and social potential, progress toward equity goals is uneven and slow. Psychologists as a group play many roles-for example, in research, education, policy, law, communications, industry, international development, and private practice-through which they can make professional contributions to gender equity as a focus or underlying principle.

TI  - PRENATAL-DIAGNOSIS AND LATE TERMINATION - A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE
T2  - AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY
AB  - The purpose of prenatal screening is obviously to identify genetic and other disorders before a child is born.  In the majority of cases, the intention is that the pregnancy should be terminated if the child is found to be affected by a serious disorder.
   Despite this expectation, the law in Victoria does not recognize fetal abnormality as a ground for abortion.  For an abortion to be lawful, the doctor must honestly believe, on reasonable grounds, that the abortion is 'necessary to preserve the woman from a serious danger to her life or her physical or mental health' and that the abortion is 'not out of proportion to the danger to be averted' (the Menhennitt rules).  Although the danger to health has been extended to include danger on economic and social grounds, it is still necessary for a doctor to base the decision to abort on the risk to the mother's health, and not on the abnormal fetus.
   When the fetus is older, a doctor may be charged with child destruction as well as abortion.  This requires proof that the doctor 'unlawfully cause[d] such child to die' and acted 'with intent to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive'.  These terms are open to interpretation but it is not necessarily a defence that the child had a serious abnormality.

TI  - Judicial Bypass of Parental Consent for Abortion Characteristics of Pregnant Minor "Jane Doe's"
T2  - JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
AB  - Pregnant minors can obtain an abortion without parental consent through a judicial bypass procedure in 38 states. To grant such a petition in Ohio, the Court must determine that the young woman is either "sufficiently mature and well enough informed to intelligently decide whether to have an abortion," or that notification of her parents is "not in her best interest," usually due to abuse. For the sake of anonymity in these emotionally and politically charged cases, the evaluee is referred to as "Jane Doe." This project sought to describe characteristics of teenagers seeking judicial bypass for abortion, which have not been well described in the scientific literature. Data were collected from Jane Doe evaluations completed at a metropolitan juvenile court psychiatric clinic, over 3 years. The mean age of the evaluees (N = 55) was 16.4 years. The vast majority (95%) were granted a judicial bypass. They usually had long-term boyfriends of comparable age. They had often told trusted adults about their pregnancy, though not their parents, due to concerns of violence or being excluded from the family. This study presents the first comprehensive description of characteristics of minors seeking judicial bypasses for abortion. Psychiatrists may apply general principles of informed consent in such evaluations, including ascertaining whether the decision is being made voluntarily, knowingly, and with sufficient decision-making capacity.

TI  - The legal status of abortion in the States if Roe v. Wade is overruled
T2  - ISSUES IN LAW & MEDICINE
AB  - This article explores the legal status of abortion in the States if the Supreme Court overrules Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973), as modified by Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992). Although an overruling decision eventually could have a significant effect on the legal status of abortion, the immediate impact of such a decision would be far more modest than most commentators-on both sides of the issue-believe.
   More than two-thirds of the States have repealed their pre-Roe laws or have amended those laws to conform to Roe v. Wade, which allows abortion for any reason before viability and for virtually any reason after viability. Pre-Roe laws that have been expressly repealed would not be revived by the overruling of Roe. Only three States that repeated their pre-Roe laws (or amended them to conform to Roe) have enacted post-Roe laws attempting to prohibit some or most abortions throughout pregnancy. Those laws have been declared unconstitutional by the federal courts and are not now enforceable.
   Of the less than one-third of the States that have retained their pre-Roe laws, most would be ineffective in prohibiting abortions. This is (1) because the laws, by their express terms or as interpreted, allow abortion on demand, for undefined health reasons or for a broad range of reasons (including mental health), or (2) because of state constitutional limitations. In yet other States, the pre-Roe laws prohibiting abortion may have been repealed by implication, due to the enactment of comprehensive post-Roe laws regulating abortion.
   In sum, no more than twelve States, and possibly as few as eight, would have enforceable laws on the books that would prohibit most abortions in the event Roe, Doe and Casey are overruled. In the other States (and the District of Columbia) abortion would be legal for most or all reasons throughout pregnancy. Although the long-term impact of reversing Roe could be quite dramatic, the author concludes that the immediate impact of such a decision would be very limited. This article is current through May 1st, 2007.

TI  - ATTITUDES OF STUDENTS OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF MOSTAR ACCORDING TO INDUCED ABORTION
T2  - PSYCHIATRIA DANUBINA
AB  - Background: Aim of this study was to establish attitudes of medical students on induced abortion and connection of those attitudes with religiousness, length of their studies, sex and various circumstances of pregnancy.
   Subjects and methods: In total, 148 students of the first, second, fifth and sixth year of medical faculty participated in the research. The study was conducted at the Medical Faculty of the University in Mostar. While collecting the data, we used a survey taken over from literature. The data were tested with adequate statistical methods afterwards.
   Results: 81.1% of students would perform an abortion under certain circumstances (chi(2)=57.189; P<0.001). Most students answered that they would perform an abortion in case that a fetus had malformations (chi(2)=3.892; P=0.49) or if the mother's life were endangered (chi(2)=47.676; P<0.001). By comparison of students' readiness to perform an abortion under various circumstances of pregnancy depending on length of medical education, statistically significant difference was proved in the following circumstances: rape (chi(2)=6.097; P=0.014) and if the pregnancy would endanger mother's mental health (chi(2)=4.488; P=0.034). Students with shorter medical education expressed more liberal attitudes in the above stated circumstances. By comparison of students' readiness to perform an abortion under various circumstances of pregnancy depending on religiousness statistically significant difference was proved in the following circumstances: in case of 'abortion on demand', no matter the reason (chi(2)=11.908; P=0.012), teenage pregnancy (chi(2)=33.308; P<0.001) and if the pregnancy would interfere with mother's career (chi(2)=35.897; P<0.001). Unreligious students expressed more liberal attitudes.
   Conclusion: Influence of length of medical education and sex on attitudes on abortion was not proved statistically. Impact of religiousness on that attitude cannot be commented due to very small share of unreligious students in the sample.

TI  - State Abortion Restrictions and the New Supreme Court: Women's Access to Reproductive Health Services
T2  - OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
AB  - The US Supreme Court's landmark 1973 ruling in Roe v Wade established a privacy right to choose abortion. However, in more recent years, many judicial cases have emerged as blatant challenges to this ruling. The recent balance shift of Supreme Court justices to a conservative-leaning majority has many concerned that the new legal environment would make it more likely to curtail reproductive rights by limiting the affordability of or access to abortions.
   The court is unlikely to review outright bans, but appears poised to incrementally uphold various restrictions. Evidence to this effect includes 7 states enacting bans on all or most abortions in 2019, which is in direct violation of Roe v Wade and a 1992 reaffirmation of Roe in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey. Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri all banned abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected (approximately 6 weeks of pregnancy), with statutes even limiting exceptions for rape and incest.
   Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia prohibit public funding for abortions (unless the woman's life is endangered or for rape or incest). Insurance coverage for public employees is prohibited in 22 states. Additionally, 11 states prohibit private insurance from covering abortions, and 26 prohibit abortion coverage in plans offered through Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges.
   While it is unlikely that the Supreme Court will overturn Roe outright, should the court uphold the limitations put forth by the various states assuming they wind their way through the lower courts making their way to the Supreme Court, it could limit the ability of many women to access services. Already, the expense of abortion, coupled with a lack of health care coverage in many states, prevents low-income women from accessing these procedures. Thus, the expansion of regulations limiting abortion funding will, in turn, exacerbate current health, social, and economic inequities. One concerning legislative approach is to define fetuses as legal "persons." In states that do so, abortions would be serious crimes, and there is a concern for abortion providers to face serious consequences. Burdensome rules will also prevent health professionals and institutions from providing abortions, which can jeopardize women's physical and mental health.

TI  - Experiences of Reproductive Coercion in Queensland Women
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
AB  - Reproductive coercion is any interference with a person's reproductive autonomy that seeks to control if and when they become pregnant, and whether the pregnancy is maintained or terminated. It includes sabotage of contraceptive methods and intervention in a woman's access to health care. Our study sought to explore the prevalence and associations with reproductive coercion within Queensland, Australia, where legislation addressing domestic violence and abortion are largely state based and undergoing a period of law reform. The study was a retrospective analysis of 3,117 Queensland women who contacted a telephone counseling and information service regarding an unplanned pregnancy. All data were collected by experienced counselors regarding circumstances within a current pregnancy between January 2015 and July 2017. Overall, experience of current domestic violence was significantly more likely to co-occur with reproductive coercion (21.1%) compared with reproductive coercion identified in the absence of other domestic violence (3.1%). Furthermore, significantly more mental health issues were reported by 36.6% of women affected by reproductive coercion, compared with 14.1% of women with no reproductive coercion present. Disclosure for reproductive coercion, violence, and mental health issues was much higher among women who made a repeat contact to the counselors about their pregnancy (17.8%) compared with those who disclosed at first contact (5.9%). These findings demonstrate the importance for health services to ensure that appropriate screening (and re-screening) for reproductive coercion is completed as a distinct part of screening for violence during a health care relationship.

TI  - Safe abortion service utilization and associated factors among insecurely housed women who experienced abortion in southwest Ethiopia, 2021: A community-based cross-sectional study
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Insecurely housed women are more vulnerable to physical and mental health issues than the general population, making access to a safe abortion more difficult. Though Ethiopia has a penal code regarding safe abortion care, there has been a dearth of studies investigating the safe abortion care practice among those insecurely housed women. Thus, this study aimed at assessing the magnitude of safe abortion service uptake and its determinants among insecurely housed women who experienced abortion in southwest Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in three towns in southwest Ethiopia from May 20-July 20, 2021. A total of 124 street-involved women were included in the study. They were selected by snowball sampling technique and data was collected through a face-to-face interview. The data were entered into Epi-data Version 3.1 and exported to SPSS 21 for analysis. A bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association of independent variables with the outcome variable. The level of significance was determined at a p-value <0.05. To determine whether the model is powerful enough in identifying any significant effects that do exist on the dependent variables, a power analysis was performed via a Post-hoc Statistical Power Calculator for Multiple Regressions.
   Results
   The magnitude of safe abortion service utilization among insecurely housed women was found to be 27.9% [95% CI: 20.1, 34.2]. Average daily income [AOR:3.83, 95% CI: 1.38, 10.60], knowledge of safe abortion services [AOR:3.94; 95% CI: 1.27,9.24], and affordability of the service [AOR: 3.27; 95% CI:1.87, 8.41] were identified as significant predictors of safe abortion service among insecurely housed women.
   Conclusion and recommendation
   The magnitude of safe abortion service utilization among insecurely housed women in the study area was low. The respective town health offices and health care providers at the facility level should strive to improve awareness about safe abortion service's legal framework, and its availability. In addition, a concerted effort is needed from local administrators, NGOs, and healthcare managers to engage those insecurely housed women in income-generating activities that allow them to access safe abortion and other reproductive and maternal health services.

TI  - Depressive disorder and grief following spontaneous abortion
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: Abortion is associated with moderate to high risk of psychological problems such as depression, use of alcohol or marijuana, anxiety, depression and suicidal behaviours. The increased risk of depression after spontaneous abortion in Asian populations has not been clearly established. Only a few studies have explored the relationship between grief and depression after abortion.
   Methods: A study was conducted to assess the prevalence and risk factors of depressive disorder and complicated grief among women 6-10 weeks after spontaneous abortion and compare the risk of depression with pregnant women attending an antenatal clinic. Spontaneous abortion group consisted of women diagnosed with spontaneous abortion by a Consultant Obstetrician. Women with confirmed or suspected induced abortion were excluded. The comparison group consisted of randomly selected pregnant, females attending the antenatal clinics of the two hospitals. Diagnosis of depressive disorder was made according to ICD-10 clinical criteria based on a structured clinical interview. This assessment was conducted in both groups. The severity of depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Grief was assessed using the Perinatal Grief Scale which was administered to the women who had experienced spontaneous abortion.
   Results: The sample consisted of 137 women in each group. The spontaneous abortion group (mean age 30.39 years (SD = 6.38) were significantly older than the comparison group (mean age 28.79 years (SD = 6.26)). There were more females with >= 10 years of education in the spontaneous abortion group (n = 54; SD = 39.4) compared to the comparison group (n = 37; SD = 27.0). The prevalence of depression in the spontaneous abortion group was 18.6 % (95 CI, 11.51-25.77). The prevalence of depression in the comparison group was 9.5 % (95 CI, 4.52-14.46). Of the 64 women fulfilling criteria for grief, 17 (26.6 %) also fulfilled criteria for a depressive episode.
   The relative risk of developing a depressive episode after spontaneous abortion was significantly higher than in females with a viable pregnancy (RR = 2.19, 95 % CI, 1.05 to 4.56). After adjustment for age and period of amenorrhoea, the difference was not significant. Prevalence of complicated grief was 54.74 % (95 % CI, 46.3-63.18).
   Conclusion: The relative risk of developing a depressive episode after spontaneous abortion was not significantly higher compared to pregnant women after taking into account age and period of amenorrhoea (POA). Almost half the women developed complicated grief after spontaneous abortion. Of these, a significant proportion also had features of depressive disorder.

TI  - The quality of the caregiving environment and child developmental outcomes associated with maternal history of abortion using the NLSY data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY AND ALLIED DISCIPLINES
AB  - Background: Studies suggest that experiencing a perinatal loss may leave women vulnerable to mental health problems and may compromise parenting. Unfortunately, compared to miscarriages and stillbirths, very little research has examined the potential for grief and feelings of loss associated with elective abortion. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the quality of the childcare environment and children's development among children of mothers with a history of abortion prior to childbirth (n = 672) and children of non post-abortive women (n = 4,172). Method: Data were derived from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), with comparisons based on two assessments of the caregiving environment and scores on four child outcome variables. The sample was divided into three child age categories: 1-4 years (n = 1,502), 5-9 years (n = 2,12 1), and 10-13 years (n = 1,524). Results: After controlling for numerous potentially confounding socio-demographic variables, lower scores were observed for the post-abortion group relative to the level of emotional support in the home among first-born children in the youngest age category. Further, among 5-9-year-olds, more behavior problems were revealed for the children of women with a history of abortion. Finally, no main effects were detected between the abortion history groups relative to the level of cognitive stimulation in the home. Conclusion: Although it is widely recognized that at least 10% of post-abortive women experience negative psychological consequences, the potential effects of negative subjective experiences on parenting need more systematic attention.

TI  - Correlates of miscarriage among young women in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health
T2  - JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE AND INFANT PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - While evidence suggests that miscarrying women experience poor mental health, the research is limited and comparison groups are frequently unrepresentative or lacking altogether. The current study examined the health and wellbeing of miscarrying women in relation to their peers by comparing them on selected relevant sociodemographic, gynaecological, psychological and health behaviour variables. Survey 3 of the Younger cohort of the nationally representative Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health was used to identify 998 women aged 24-31 who reported ever having had a miscarriage, and 8083 women who reported never having had a miscarriage. Although univariate analyses indicated that women who had had miscarriages experienced poorer mental health, multivariate analysis indicated that these effects were explained by sociodemographic and lifestyle differences. Stepwise logistic regression showed that miscarrying women were more likely to be married, to have had a child, to be current or ex-smokers and to be not using contraception, to have lower levels of education; and to be of low socio-economic status. These results indicate that the strongest correlates of miscarriage among young women are those associated with preparing for, or experiencing, motherhood, and it may be that these factors rather than the miscarriage itself explain any excess of mental health problems in this population.

TI  - Previous pregnancy outcomes and subsequent pregnancy anxiety in a Quebec prospective cohort
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Pregnancy anxiety is an important psychosocial risk factor that may be more strongly associated with adverse birth outcomes than other measures of stress. Better understanding of the upstream predictors and causes of pregnancy anxiety could help to identify high-risk women for adverse maternal and infant outcomes. The objective of the present study was to measure the associations between five past pregnancy outcomes (live preterm birth (PTB), live term birth, miscarriage at <20 weeks, stillbirth at 20 weeks, and elective abortion) and pregnancy anxiety at three trimesters in a subsequent pregnancy.Methods: Analyses were conducted using data from the 3D Cohort Study, a Canadian birth cohort. Data on maternal demographic characteristics and pregnancy history for each known previous pregnancy were collected via interviewer-administered questionnaires at study entry. Pregnancy anxiety for the index study pregnancy was measured prospectively by self-administered questionnaire following three prenatal study visits.Results: Of 2366 participants in the 3D Study, 1505 had at least one previous pregnancy. In linear regression analyses with adjustment for confounding variables, prior live term birth was associated with lower pregnancy anxiety in all three trimesters, whereas prior miscarriage was significantly associated with higher pregnancy anxiety in the first trimester. Prior stillbirth was associated with greater pregnancy anxiety in the third trimester. Prior elective abortion was significantly associated with higher pregnancy anxiety scores in the first and second trimesters, with an association of similar magnitude observed in the third trimester.Discussion: Our findings suggest that the outcomes of previous pregnancies should be incorporated, along with demographic and psychosocial characteristics, into conceptual models framing pregnancy anxiety.

TI  - Mobile phone messages to provide support to women during the home phase of medical abortion in South Africa: a randomised controlled trial
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Objectives: Home use of misoprostol for medical abortion is more convenient for many women than in-clinic use but requires management of abortion symptoms at home without provider backup. This study evaluated whether automated text messages to women undergoing medical abortion can reduce anxiety and emotional discomfort, and whether the messages can better prepare women for symptoms they experience.
   Study design: A multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted in which women undergoing early medical abortion were allocated to receive standard of care (SOC) only (n=235) or SOC+a messaging intervention (n=234). Consenting women were interviewed at the clinic after taking mifepristone and again at their follow-up clinic visit 2-3 weeks later; the intervention group received text messages over the duration of this period. Emotional outcomes were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Adler's 12-item emotional scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Preparedness for the abortion symptoms and overall satisfaction with the procedure were assessed using 4-point Likert-type scales.
   Results: Between baseline and follow-up, anxiety decreased more (p=0.013), and less emotional stress was experienced (adjusted for baseline anxiety, p=0.015), in the intervention compared to the SOC group. Participants in the intervention group were also more likely to report that they felt very well prepared for the bleeding (p<0.001), pain (p=0.042) and side effects (p=0.027) they experienced. Acceptability and other negative emotions relating to the abortion did not differ between study groups. Ninety-nine percent of the intervention group stated that they would recommend the messages to a friend having the same procedure.
   Conclusions: Text messages to women following mifepristone administration for early medical abortion may assist them in managing symptoms and appear highly acceptable to recipients.
   Implication Statement: This randomized controlled trial provides evidence for the effectiveness of text messages following mifepristone administration in strengthening medical abortion care. The messages were associated with significant reductions in women's anxiety and stress during the abortion process; they improved preparedness for the abortion symptoms experienced and appeared highly acceptable.

TI  - Hormone replacement therapy: informed consent without assessment?
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
AB  - Florence Ashley has argued that requiring patients with gender dysphoria to undergo an assessment and referral from a mental health professional before undergoing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is unethical and may represent an unconscious hostility towards transgender people. We respond, first, by showing that Ashley has conflated the self-reporting of symptoms with self-diagnosis, and that this is not consistent with the standard model of informed consent to medical treatment. Second, we note that the model of informed consent involved in cosmetic surgery resembles the model Ashley defends, and that psychological assessment and referral is recognised as an important aspect of such a model. Third, we suggest that the increased prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the transgender population arguably supports the requirement of assessment and referral from a mental health professional prior to undergoing HRT.

TI  - Interpersonal stress
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The present article reports a study verifying the validity of an Interpersonal Stress Model based on Lazar-us's stress theory. The proposed model assumes that the effects of personality on mental health are fully mediated by cognitive appraisals and the behavior of coping with interpersonal stressful events, and that the effects of appraisals on mental health are fully mediated by coping behavior. The results of a longitudinal study of 227 college students, using path analyses, supported the Interpersonal Stress Model. The relationship between personality and coping behavior was fully mediated by cognitive appraisals. In part, a significant direct relationship was observed between personality and coping behavior. Coping that was oriented more toward positive relationships and postponed-solution coping were predictive of a report of a higher feeling of satisfaction with interpersonal relationships whereas coping that was oriented more toward negative relationships was predictive of a report of a lower feeling of satisfaction with interpersonal relationships. Greater postponed-solution coping was associated with reports of reduced distress, and coping that was oriented more toward negative relationships, with increased distress.

TI  - Disproportionate impact of abortion restriction: Implications for emergency department clinicians
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Individuals experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) and/or human trafficking (HT) are at increased risk of severe health consequences as a result of legislation criminalizing and/or restricting abortion, which is expected to increase as a result of the Supreme Court decision Dobbs v. Jackson. These risks are further stratified by race, socioeconomics, and other marginalizing demographic attributes. IPV and HT introduce barriers to maintaining physical and mental health, due to control of access to transportation and funds by the abuser, fear of retribution for seeking healthcare, and other barriers. Individuals experiencing IPV or HT often lack reproductive autonomy, as a result of facing reproductive coercion at the hands of their abusers. Following the Dobbs decision, these vulnerable patient populations will face further limitations on their reproductive autonomy and increased obstacles to obtaining an abortion if they medically need or desire one. This will likely result in more patients presenting to the emergency department due to complications from unsafe or unsupervised self-managed abortions, as well as patients being reluctant to report having obtained an unlawful abortion due to fear of legal consequences. This is particularly relevant to individuals experiencing IPV and HT, as they may be more likely to use these methods for obtaining an abortion due to numerous barriers. Emergency medicine clinicians are vital in providing care to these patients, as they frequently present to emergency departments. A multi-pronged approach to better support these patients is essential, involving an increased index of suspicion for IPV, HT or the complications of unsupervised abortion, improved organizational structures, specialized training for staff, improved screening methods, reflection on implicit bias, and recommendations for mindful documentation and legal considerations.

T2  - MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
AB  - There is extensive evidence of the adverse effects of domestic violence across all age groups and cultural backgrounds.
   The impact of domestic violence may be long-term, affecting emotional adjustment, physical health and subsequent relationships.
   Health professionals should be aware of the confounding effect of youth, age and cultural diversity on presentation.
   Shame and isolation militate against disclosure.
   Specific, sensitive questioning that incorporates awareness of cultural and social issues is essential to detect domestic violence and initiate appropriate assistance.

TI  - Report of the procedure of voluntary interruption of pregnancy at a university hospital in Uruguay
T2  - REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the constitution and operation of a voluntary interruption of pregnancy team of a university hospital, from the outlook of the mental health team.
   METHODS: In this case study, the following aspects were analyzed: 1) historical background; 2) implementation of Law 18,897 of October 22, 2012; and 3) functioning of the program at the Hospital de Clinicas of the Facultad de Medicina (Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay), taking into account three dimensions: structure, process, and results.
   RESULTS: Between December 2012 and November 2013, a total of 6,676 voluntary interruptions of pregnancy were reported in Uruguay; out of these, 80 were conducted at the Hospital de Clinicas. The patients' demographic data agreed with those reported at the national level: Of the total patients, 81.0% were aged over 19 years; 6.2% decided to continue with the pregnancy; and only 70.0% attended the subsequent control and received advice on contraception.
   CONCLUSIONS: In its implementation year in Uruguay, we can assess the experience as positive from the point of view of women's health. Our experience as a mental health team at the Hospital de Clinicas, inserted into the multidisciplinary voluntary interruption of pregnancy team, is in the process of assessment and reformulation of practices.

TI  - Human rights accountability for maternal death and failure to provide safe, legal abortion: the significance of two ground-breaking CEDAW decisions
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS
AB  - In 2011, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) issued two landmark decisions. In Alyne da Silva Pimentel v. Brazil, the first maternal death case decided by an international human rights body, it confirms that States have a human rights obligation to guarantee that all women, irrespective of their income or racial background, have access to timely, non-discriminatory, and appropriate maternal health services. In L.C. v. Peru, concerning a 13-year-old rape victim who was denied a therapeutic abortion and had an operation on her spine delayed that left her seriously disabled as a result, it established that the State should guarantee access to abortion when a woman's physical or mental health is in danger, decriminalise abortion when pregnancy results from rape or sexual abuse, review its restrictive interpretation of therapeutic abortion and establish a mechanism to ensure that reproductive rights are understood and observed in all health care facilities. Both cases affirm that accessible and good quality health services are vital to women's human rights and expand States' obligations in relation to these. They also affirm that States must ensure national accountability for sexual and reproductive health rights, and provide remedies and redress in the event of violations. And they reaffirm the importance of international human rights bodies as sources of accountability for sexual and reproductive rights violations, especially where national accountability is absent or ineffective.

TI  - Effectiveness of Group Psychotherapy for Adult Outpatients Traumatized by Abuse, Neglect, and/or Pregnancy Loss: A Multiple-Site, Pre-Post-Follow-Up, Naturalistic Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GROUP PSYCHOTHERAPY
AB  - The New Experience for Survivors of Trauma (NEST) is a group psychotherapy intervention for clients traumatized by consequences of abuse, neglect, and pregnancy loss. This multiple site study is the first investigation of its effectiveness. Ninety outpatients from. a naturalistic setting completed the Symptom Checklist and the Sense of Coherence questionnaire at baseline, end of treatment, and one-year follow-up. Effectiveness was tested with statistical significance, effect size, and clinical significance. Clients from the total sample as well as from the abortion subsample showed improvement at the end of treatment and at follow-up. Lack of a control group is balanced to some extent by the high ecological validity. The findings suggest that the NEST treatment may be beneficial for traumatized clients and call for further research.

TI  - Abortion and methods of reproductive planning: the views of Malta's medical doctor cohort
T2  - SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS
AB  - Malta is the only EU country where abortion remains illegal in all circumstances. This study aims to assess the previously unexplored views of Malta's medical doctors on the legality of contraception, abortion, assisted reproductive technology and surrogacy. Following ethics approval, 1578 out of a total of 2468 registered medical doctors in Malta were invited for an anonymous survey. The response rate was 28.8% (n=454), guaranteeing a maximum margin of error of 4.16% assuming a 95% confidence level. Responses consisted of "Yes", "No", and "Not sure". In the abortion section, "Yes" responses were specific to different gestational age limits. A majority supported all contraceptive methods being legal: morning-after pill (59.7%); intra-uterine device (85.9%); surgical sterilisation (>70%). A majority also agreed with in-vitro fertilisation being legal (93.8%). Embryo freezing and surrogacy garnered less support (39.9% and 40.5% respectively). Legalising abortion for "Woman's life in danger" and "Non-viable fetal anomaly" was supported at least up to 12 weeks gestation by 66.8% and 63.0% respectively, and in all stages of pregnancy by 54.2% and 50.2% respectively. Support, at least up to 12 weeks gestation, was less for other circumstances: "Rape or incest" (35.3%); "Preserve a woman's physical health" (30.0%); "Preserve a woman's mental health" (26.8%); "Viable fetal anomaly" (24.6%); "<16 years of age" (23.8%); "Economic/social reasons" (18.9%); "Any circumstance" (14.5%). According to the surveyed respondents, there is at present a clear majority of doctors in Malta who do not agree with the total legal ban on abortion and support its legalisation in limited circumstances.

TI  - Pregnancies, Abortions, and Births among Women with and without Borderline Personality Disorder
T2  - WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to examine history of pregnancies among women with and without borderline personality disorder (BPD), to determine whether BPD symptoms are associated with teenage pregnancies, unplanned pregnancies, elective and spontaneous abortions, and live births.
   Methods: Three hundred seventy-nine women completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses, Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality for Axis II diagnoses, and a reproductive health interview. African-American (AA) women were oversampled, because little is known about BPD in AA women and they are at greater risk of teenage pregnancy, unplanned pregnancies, and spontaneous abortions.
   Results: BPD symptom severity was associated with a teenage pregnancy, even after controlling for race and socio-economic status. Symptom severity was also associated with unplanned pregnancies and live births, but only for women without a history of a substance use disorder. BPD symptom severity was not associated with abortion.
   Conclusion: Women with BPD become pregnant and have children, often during the period when BPD symptoms emerge and intensify. They are at increased risk of teenage pregnancies and unintended pregnancies compared with women with Axis I disorders. Treatment planning for this population should include attention to their reproductive health and better integration of physical and mental health services.

TI  - Protect and Control: Coverture's Logics Across Welfare Policy and Abortion Law
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY
AB  - In the aftermath of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned the federal constitutional right to abortion, states have begun to recriminalize the procedure. These abortion bans raise important questions about the political and social status of women and pregnant people in the United States. Moreover, restrictions in social welfare programs such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which serve low-income pregnant people and parents, raise similar questions. The regulation and administration of all three are framed by race, class, and gender. To understand how these restrictions (a) claim to protect women but ultimately function to control, police, and surveil and (b) rely on imagined, stereotype-laden psychological states such as vulnerability, irresponsibility, or irrationality, we turn to the British Common Law doctrine of coverture, which subsumed a married woman's legal, financial, and political identities under her husband's. The American colonies, and later, states of the United States, drew from British Common Law to craft laws that regulated relationships between men and women. Taken together, this analysis can provide a more comprehensive accounting of the cumulative harms experienced by women, poor people, people of color, and pregnant people in today's health and social welfare landscape. We conclude with recommendations for psychologists and other mental health providers to address, in practice and advocacy, the ethical dilemmas and obligations raised by the reach of coverture's logics in people's lives.

TI  - Analyzing the relationship between feelings about pregnancy and mother-infant bonding with the onset of maternal psychological distress after childbirth: The Japan Environment and Children's Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Strengthening maternal mental health from early pregnancy is essential. This study investigated the factors affecting the onset of maternal psychological distress at 12 months after childbirth in women who had not experienced it during pregnancy. Methods: Feelings about pregnancy were assessed using a questionnaire in the first trimester, and maternal mental health was assessed using the 6-Item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) in the first and second/ third trimesters and at 12 months after childbirth. Mother-infant bonding was assessed using the Japanese version of Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS-J) in the first, sixth, and twelfth months after childbirth. This study comprised 46,053 mothers without psychological distress (K6 <= 4) during pregnancy from the 97,415 mothers enrolled in the Japan Environment and Children's Study. Results: The onset of psychological distress at 12 months after childbirth was associated with negative maternal feelings about pregnancy, a history of infertility treatment before the current pregnancy, and poor mother-infant bonding after childbirth. Abortion history was not associated with psychological distress. The strongest factor affecting the onset of psychological distress was mother-infant bonding (beta = 0.28), and the indirect effect of feelings about pregnancy was also observed (beta = 0.10). Limitations: We used the full version of MIBS-J consisting of 10 items at 12 months after childbirth but included only five items in the first and sixth months. Conclusions: Inadequate mother-infant bonding was associated with the onset of maternal psychological distress after childbirth. Supporting mother-infant bonding is critical throughout the perinatal period, considering maternal feelings about pregnancy.

TI  - Reproductive Coercion Victimization and Associated Mental Health Outcomes Among Female-Identifying Young Adults
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA & DISSOCIATION
AB  - Reproductive coercion is a serious public health problem. Victimization has been associated with poor mental health outcomes, including symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in clinical and college samples. We build on these findings by examining the association between reproductive coercion victimization and mental and behavioral health outcomes, including depression, PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and drinking behaviors in a diverse community-derived sample of female-identifying young adults (mean age = 20; SD=.72). Participants (n = 368) were originally recruited as part of a study on dating violence in seven Texas public high schools. Participants completed an online study that included demographic questions and measures that assessed the variables of interest. Results of regression analyses showed that reproductive coercion victimization predicted depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms, after controlling for race, sexual orientation, and age. The findings also revealed that victims of reproductive coercion were more likely consume more drinks per drinking occasion compared to their non-victimized counterparts. These results add to the growing literature that experiencing reproductive coercion is a risk marker for poor mental and behavioral health. To develop targeted prevention and intervention programs, future research should examine potential mechanisms underlying this relationship.

TI  - Abortions - Decision-Making Processes and Experiences with Psychosocial and Medical Care from the Perspective of Young Women
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SEXUALFORSCHUNG
AB  - Zusammenfassung
   Einleitung Schwangerschaftsabbruche sichern reproduktive Selbstbestimmung und sind als Menschenrecht anerkannt. Gleichzeitig werden sie oft gesellschaftlich missbilligt, sind in Deutschland nach wie vor strafrechtlich verankert und erfordern eine Pflichtberatung.
   Forschungsziele Die vorliegende Studie verfolgt das Ziel zu rekonstruieren, warum und wie junge Frauen sich unter diesen Bedingungen fur einen Schwangerschaftsabbruch entscheiden, wie sie dabei die Pflichtberatung und die medizinische Versorgung einschatzen und den Abbruch im Ruckblick bewerten.
   Methoden Interviewdaten von n = 10 Studentinnen, die wahrend ihrer (hoch-)schulischen Ausbildung einen Abbruch vornehmen lie ss en, wurden qualitativ erhoben und inhaltsanalytisch ausgewertet.
   Ergebnisse Die Daten zeigen, dass die Befragten klare und oft ahnliche Grunde fur den Abbruch hatten und die Pflichtberatung bei ihrer Entscheidungsfindung kaum eine Rolle spielte. Im Ruckblick beurteilten die Frauen den Abbruch als richtige Entscheidung.
   Schlussfolgerung Sinn und Nutzen der Pflichtberatung nach 218a StGB gilt es ebenso zu uberdenken wie das gesamte Unterstutzungssystem, das bei ungewollten Schwangerschaften bereitsteht.
   Abstract
   Introduction Abortions ensure reproductive self-determination and are recognised as a human right. At the same time, they are often socially disapproved of, are still anchored in German criminal law, and require mandatory psychosocial counselling.
   Objectives The present study aims to reconstruct why and how young women decide under these conditions to have an abortion, how they assess the mandatory psychosocial counselling and medical care, and how they assess the abortion in retrospect.
   Methods Qualitative interview data were collected from n = 10 female university students who had an abortion during their high school/college education and analysed in terms of content.
   Results The data show that the interviewees had clear and often similar reasons for the abortion and that mandatory psychosocial counselling hardly played a role at all in their decision-making. In retrospect, the women assessed the abortion as the right decision.
   Conclusion The sense and benefit of compulsory counselling according to 218a StGB (German Criminal Code) has to be reconsidered as well as the whole support system that is available in case of unwanted pregnancies.

TI  - "Every Medicine Is Somewhat Poisonous": Understanding the reluctance to use oral contraceptives among unmarried women seeking abortion in China
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Objectives: In this study, I examined the low uptake of oral contraceptives (OCs) in China and the fac-tors affecting the reluctance among unmarried Chinese women seeking abortion to use OCs to prevent unintended pregnancies.Study design: I conducted ethnographic and participant observation in multiple medical facilities and interviewed 62 women who were seeking or had had an abortion between 2013 and 2017 in a coastal city in east China. I analyzed data regarding the women's perceptions and experiences of using OCs through a thematic analysis approach.Results: The women reported fear of side effects, including inf ertility, weight gain, and mental health issues and their view on traditional Chinese medicine further validated their skepticism toward West-ern medicine. Discouragement from male partners and a lack of sexual and reproductive education also caused their hesitancy and misunderstandings of OCs.Conclusions: This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the barriers to OC use in China. It resonates with existing studies that associate the reluctance to use OCs with the fear of side effects and highlights the influence of sociocultural specificities and couple interactions in shaping contraceptive use.Implications: Tackling premarital abortions is one of the priorities of the Chinese government in the face of the population crisis. Service providers and educators should understand unmarried women's reluc-tance to use OCs and provide comprehensive sexuality education and postabortion counseling services to women and men to dispel culturally specific misconceptions.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Women with unwanted pregnancies, their psychosocial problems, and contraceptive use in primary care in Northern Netherlands: insights from a primary care registry database
T2  - FAMILY PRACTICE
AB  - Introduction Globally an estimated 1 in 16 women per year experience an unwanted pregnancy (UWP). In the Netherlands, general practitioners (GPs) play an important role in providing care for women with UWP; however, it is unknown how many of these women consult their GP about the pregnancy. UWPs are a major life experience with a possible influence on mental health. Data that GPs register about UWPs, psychosocial problems, and contraceptive use could give more insight into care needs. Aims To create an overview of (i) the prevalence of UWPs in general practice, (ii) the prevalence of psychosocial problems in women with UWP, and (iii) contraceptive use of women with UWP. Methods GP registration data were analysed from 58 general practices located in Northern Netherlands between 2015 and 2019. Patient files were checked for registration of ICPC and ATC codes concerning pregnancy, psychosocial health, and contraceptive use. Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were used to calculate differences between women with a UWP and women with a wanted pregnancy (WP). An analysis of registration dates was conducted to determine when the psychosocial problems were registered in relation to the pregnancy. Results Of female patients of reproductive age, 1.6% had a UWP and 11.8% had a WP. Women with a UWP reported statistically significantly more psychosocial problems. Furthermore, statistically significantly more contraceptive methods were prescribed to women with UWP compared with both women with WP and women without pregnancy. Discussion and conclusion The finding that women with UWP experience more psychosocial problems can be used to improve aftercare and can be incorporated into current guidelines for GPs.

TI  - Pregnancy Options Counseling for Adolescents: Overcoming Barriers to Care and Preserving Preference
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN PEDIATRIC AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH CARE
AB  - Current clinical guidelines for counseling adolescent patients about their pregnancy options fail to give concrete suggestions for how to begin and hold conversations that support patient autonomy, provide accurate and unbiased information, and address barriers to care. Recent research suggests that relative to adult women, adolescents are at increased risk of being denied abortion because they present beyond facilities' gestational age limits. Counseling that neglects to address the structural and developmental challenges that adolescents face when seeking care may contribute to the risk of abortion denial as well as subsequent delays in prenatal care. The task of providing non-directive, patient-centered, evidence-based pregnancy options counseling to an adolescent while ensuring that she receives her chosen course of care in a timely manner is challenging. This article presents a shared decision-making framework and specific suggestions for healthcare providers to support adolescent patients in coming to their decision about whether to continue or terminate an unplanned pregnancy and access follow-up care within the current sociopolitical environment.

TI  - Variation in Restrictive Abortion Policies and Adverse Birth Outcomes in the United States from 2005 to 2015
T2  - WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES
AB  - Background: Since 2011, U.S. states have enacted more than 400 policies restricting abortion access. As structural determinants, abortion policies have the potential to influence maternal and child health access, outcomes, and equity through multiple mechanisms. Limited research has examined their implications for birth outcomes. Methods: We created a state-level abortion restrictiveness index composed of 18 restrictive abortion policies and evaluated the association between this index and individual-level probabilities of preterm birth (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW) within the United States and by Census Region, using data from the 2005-2015 National Center for Health Statistics Period Linked Live Birth-Infant Death Files. We used logistic multivariable regression modeling, adjusting for individual-and state-level factors and state and year fixed effects.Results: Among 2,500,000 live births, 269,253 (12.0%) were PTBs and 182,960 (8.1%) were LBW. On average from 2005 to 2015, states had approximately seven restrictive abortion policies enacted, with more policies enacted in the Midwest and South. Nationally, relationships between state restrictiveness indices and adverse birth outcomes were insignificant. Regional analyses revealed that a 1 standard deviation increase in a state's restrictiveness index was associated with a 2% increase in PTB in the Midwest (marginal effect [ME], 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.45; p < .01), a 15% increase in LBW in the Northeast (ME, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.12-2.35; p < .05), and a 2% increase in LBW in the West (ME, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.01-0.25; p < .05). Conclusion: Variation in restrictive abortion policy environments may have downstream implications for birth outcomes, and increases in abortion restrictions were associated with adverse birth outcomes in three out of four Census Regions.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Reproductive health and access to healthcare facilities: risk factors for depression and anxiety in women with an earthquake experience
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: The reproductive and mental health of women contributes significantly to their overall well-being. Three of the eight Millennium Development Goals are directly related to reproductive and sexual health while mental disorders make up three of the ten leading causes of disease burden in low and middle-income countries. Among mental disorders, depression and anxiety are two of the most prevalent. In the context of slower progress in achieving Millennium Development Goals in developing countries and the ever-increasing man-made and natural disasters in these areas, it is important to understand the association between reproductive health and mental health among women with post-disaster experiences.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 387 women of reproductive age (15-49 years) randomly selected from the October 2005 earthquake affected areas of Pakistan. Data on reproductive health was collected using the Centers for Disease Control reproductive health assessment toolkit. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, while earthquake experiences were captured using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. The association of either depression or anxiety with socio-demographic variables, earthquake experiences, reproductive health and access to health facilities was estimated using multivariate logistic regression.
   Results: Post-earthquake reproductive health events together with economic deprivation, lower family support and poorer access to health care facilities explained a significant proportion of differences in the experiencing of clinical levels of depression and anxiety. For instance, women losing resources for subsistence, separation from family and experiencing reproductive health events such as having a stillbirth, having had an abortion, having had abnormal vaginal discharge or having had genital ulcers, were at significant risk of depression and anxiety.
   Conclusion: The relationship between women's post-earthquake mental health and reproductive health, socio-economic status, and health care access is complex and explained largely by the socio-cultural role of women. It is suggested that interventions that consider gender differences and that are culturally appropriate are likely to reduce the incidence.

TI  - Special ambulatory gynecologic considerations in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implications for future practice
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has altered medical practice in unprecedented ways. Although much of the emphasis in ob-stetrics and gynecology to date has been on the as yet uncertain effects of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and on changes to surgical management, the pandemic has broad implications for ambulatory gynecologic care. In this article, we review important ambulatory gynecologic topics such as safety and mental health, reproductive life planning, sexually transmitted infections, and routine screening for breast and cervical cancer. For each topic, we review how care may be modified during the pandemic, provide recom-mendations when possible on how to ensure continued access to comprehensive healthcare at this time, and discuss ways that future practice may change. Social distancing requirements may place patients at higher risk for intimate partner violence and mental health concerns, threaten continued access to contraception and abortion services, affect prepregnancy planning, interrupt routine screening for breast and cervical cancer, increase risk of sexually transmitted infection acquisition and decrease access to treatment, and exacerbate already underlying racial and minority disparities in care and health outcomes. We advocate for increased use of telemedicine services with increased screening for intimate partner violence and depression using validated questionnaires. Appointments for long-acting contra-ceptive insertions can be prioritized. Easier access to patient-controlled injectable contraception and pharmacist-provided hormonal contraception can be facilitated. Reproductive healthcare access can be ensured through reducing needs for ultrasonography and lab-oratory testing for certain eligible patients desiring abortion and conducting phone follow-up for medication abortions. Priority for in-person appointments should be given to patients with sexually transmitted infection symptoms, particularly if at risk for complications, while also offering expedited partner therapy. Although routine mammography screening and cervical cancer screening may be safely delayed, we discuss society guideline recommendations for higher-risk populations. There may be an increasing role for patient-collected human papillomavirus self-samples using new cervical cancer screening guidelines that can be expanded considering the pandemic situation. Although the pandemic has strained our healthcare system, it also affords ambulatory clinicians with opportunities to expand care to vulnerable populations in ways that were previously underutilized to improve health equity.

TI  - Disasters and Perinatal Health: A Systematic Review
T2  - OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
AB  - Background. The empirical literature on the effects of disaster on pregnancy and the postpartum period is limited. The objective of this review was to examine the existing evidence on the effect of disasters on perinatal health.
   Methods. A systematic review was conducted by searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl, PsycInfo), including literature on disasters and pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital anomalies), mental health, and child development. A total of 110 articles were identified, but many published reports were anecdotes or recommendations rather than systematic studies. The final review included 49 peer-reviewed studies that met inclusion criteria.
   Results. Studies addressing the World Trade Center disaster of September 11 and other terrorist attacks, environmental/chemical disasters, and natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes were identified. Disasters of various types may reduce fetal growth in some women, although there does not appear to be an effect on gestational age at birth. Severity of exposure is the major predictor of mental health issues among pregnant and postpartum women. After a disaster, mental health of the mother may more strongly influence on child development than any direct effect of disaster-related prenatal stress.
   Conclusions. There is evidence that disaster impacts maternal mental health and some perinatal health outcomes, particular among highly exposed women. Future research should focus on understudied outcomes such as spontaneous abortion. Relief workers and clinicians should concentrate on the most exposed women, particularly with respect to mental health.
   Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists
   Learning Objectives: After completion of this educational activity, the obstetrician/gynecologist should be better able to compare and contrast the effects of different types of disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, chemical spills) on pregnant and postpartum women in order to prepare for patient care in the aftermath of such disasters; differentiate the birth outcomes likely to be affected by disaster, in order to identify patients likely to be at high risk; and assess the extent to which pregnant and postpartum women are a uniquely vulnerable population after disaster, to assist in organizing care under such circumstances.

TI  - Anxiety and depression in pregnant women who have experienced a previous perinatal loss: a case-cohort study from Scandinavia
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB  - BackgroundPerinatal loss can have long-lasting adverse effects on a woman's psychosocial health, including during subsequent pregnancies. However, maternal mental health status after perinatal loss during subsequent pregnancy is understudied with very little data available for Scandinavian populations.AimsThe primary aim of the study was to explore the association between previous perinatal loss and anxiety/depression symptoms of expectant mothers during the subsequent pregnancy. The secondary aim of this study was to explore possible determinants of maternal mental health during the subsequent pregnancy, independent of previous perinatal loss.MethodThis case-cohort study is based on primary data from Scandinavian Successive Small-for-Gestational Age Births Study (SGA Study) in Norway and Sweden. The total case-cohort sample in the current study includes 1458 women. Cases include 401 women who had reported a previous perinatal loss (spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal death) and who responded to two mental health assessment instruments, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association between previous perinatal loss and maternal mental health in subsequent pregnancy.ResultsScandinavian pregnant women with previous perinatal loss reported higher symptoms for both anxiety and depression during their subsequent pregnancy compared to mothers in the same cohort reported no previous perinatal loss. Multiple linear regression analyses showed a positive association between previous perinatal loss and per unit increase in both total anxiety score (beta: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.49-1.95) and total depression score (beta: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.06-1.74). We identified several factors associated with maternal mental health during pregnancy independent of perinatal loss, including unintended pregnancy despite 97% of our population being married/cohabitating.ConclusionWomen who have experienced previous perinatal loss face a significantly higher risk of anxiety and depression symptoms in their subsequent pregnancy.

TI  - The Rajarata Pregnancy Cohort (RaPCo): study protocol
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB  - Background Ending preventable maternal deaths remains a global priority and in the later stages of obstetric transition, identifying the social determinants of maternal health outcomes is essential to address stagnating maternal mortality rates. Countries would hardly achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SGD) targets on maternal health, unless the complex and context-specific socio-economic aetiologies associated with maternal mental health and suicide are identified. The Rajarata Pregnancy Cohort (RaPCo) is a prospective cohort study, designed to explore the interactions between social determinants and maternal mental health in determining pregnancy and new-born outcomes. Methods The study will recruit all eligible pregnant women in the maternal care programme of Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka from July to September 2019. The estimated sample size is 2400. We will assess the socio-demographic and economic status, social capital, gender-based violence and mental health, including a clinical examination and biochemical investigations during the first trimester. Participants will undergo four follow-ups at 2nd and 3rd trimesters, at delivery and in early postpartum. The new-borns will be followed up at birth, neonatal period, at 6 six months and at 1 year. Pregnancy and child outcome data will be collected using direct contact. Qualitative studies will be carried out to understand the complex social factors and behavioural dimensions related to abortion, antenatal depression, maternal deaths and near misses. Discussion This is the first reported maternal cohort in Sri Lanka focusing on social determinants and mental health. As a country in stage four of obstetric transition, these findings will provide generalizable evidence on achieving SGD targets in low- and middle-income countries. The study will be conducted in a district with multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and diverse community characteristics; thus, will enable the evidence generated to be applied in many different contexts. The study also possesses the strength of using direct participant contact, data collection, measurement, examination and biochemical testing to minimise errors in routinely collected data. The RaPCo study will be able to generate evidence to strengthen policies to further reduce maternal deaths in the local, regional and global contexts particularly focusing on social factors and mental health, which are not optimally addressed in the global agenda.

TI  - Stressful Life Events Around the Time of Unplanned Pregnancy and Women's Health: Exploratory Findings from a National Sample
T2  - MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL
AB  - Objective Little is known about how women's social context of unintended pregnancy, particularly adverse social circumstances, relates to their general health and wellbeing. We explored associations between stressful life events around the time of unintended pregnancy and physical and mental health. Methods Data are drawn from a national probability study of 1078 U.S. women aged 18-55. Our internet-based survey measured 14 different stressful life events occurring at the time of unintended pregnancy (operationalized as an additive index score), chronic disease and mental health conditions, and current health and wellbeing symptoms (standardized perceived health, depression, stress, and discrimination scales). Multivariable regression modeled relationships between stressful life events and health conditions/symptoms while controlling for sociodemographic and reproductive covariates. Results Among ever-pregnant women (N = 695), stressful life events were associated with all adverse health outcomes/symptoms in unadjusted analyses. In multivariable models, higher stressful life event scores were positively associated with chronic disease (aOR 1.21, CI 1.03-1.41) and mental health (aOR 1.42, CI 1.23-1.64) conditions, higher depression (B 0.37, CI 0.19-0.55), stress (B 0.32, CI 0.22-0.42), and discrimination (B 0.74, CI 0.45-1.04) scores, and negatively associated with ae<yen> very good perceived health (aOR 0.84, CI 0.73-0.97). Stressful life event effects were strongest for emotional and partner-related sub-scores. Conclusion Women with adverse social circumstances surrounding their unintended pregnancy experienced poorer health. Findings suggest that reproductive health should be considered in the broader context of women's health and wellbeing and have implications for integrated models of care that address women's family planning needs, mental and physical health, and social environments.

TI  - Sexual and Reproductive Health Services and Related Health Information on Pregnancy Resource Center Websites: A Statewide Content Analysis
T2  - WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES
AB  - Background: Pregnancy resource centers (PRCs) are nonprofit organizations with a primary mission of promoting childbirth among pregnant women. Given a new state grant program to publicly fund PRCs, we analyzed Georgia PRC websites to describe advertised services and related health information.
   Methods: We systematically identified all accessible Georgia PRC websites available from April to June 2016. Entire websites were obtained and coded using defined protocols.
   Results: Of 64 reviewed websites, pregnancy tests and testing (98%) and options counseling (84%) were most frequently advertised. However, 58% of sites did not provide notice that PRCs do not provide or refer for abortion, and 53% included false or misleading statements regarding the need to make a decision about abortion or links between abortion and mental health problems or breast cancer. Advertised contraceptive services were limited to counseling about natural family planning (3%) and emergency contraception (14%). Most sites (89%) did not provide notice that PRCs do not provide or refer for contraceptives. Two sites (3%) advertised unproven "abortion reversal" services. Approximately 63% advertised ultrasound examinations, 22% sexually transmitted infection testing, and 5% sexually transmitted infection treatment. None promoted consistent and correct condom use; 78% with content about condoms included statements that seemed to be designed to undermine confidence in condom effectiveness. Approximately 84% advertised educational programs, and 61% material resources.
   Conclusions: Georgia PRC websites contain high levels of false and misleading health information; the advertised services do not seem to align with prevailing medical guidelines. Public funding for PRCs, an increasing national trend, should be rigorously examined. Increased regulation may be warranted to ensure quality health information and services.

TI  - Young Women's Experiences Obtaining Judicial Bypass for Abortion in Texas
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
AB  - Purpose: Like many states, Texas requires parental consent for adolescents under 18 to access abortion care. Adolescents who cannot obtain parental consent can try to obtain a judicial bypass of parental consent through the court system. Little is known about adolescents' experiences with the judicial bypass process. Working with Jane's Due Process, an organization providing legal representation for adolescents, we explored adolescents' experiences with the judicial bypass process.
   Methods: We conducted phone interviews with 20 adolescents, 16-19 years old in Texas between September and December 2016 about their experiences trying to obtain a judicial bypass. Data analysis included inductive and deductive coding based on theories about engaging with the court system and stigma regarding abortion and adolescent sexuality.
   Results: In addition to unpredictability and logistic burdens such as finding time away from school and arranging transportation, participants described the bypass process as "intimidating" and "scary" and described judges and guardians-ad-litem who shamed them, "preached" at them, and discredited evidence of their maturity. Data suggest adolescents internalize stigma and trauma they experienced through rationalizing both the need for the bypass process and disrespectful treatment by authority figures.
   Conclusions: We found the bypass process functions as a form of punishment and allows state actors to humiliate adolescents for their personal decisions. The bypass process was implemented to protect adolescents from alleged negative emotional consequences of abortion, yet our results suggest the bypass process itself causes emotional harm through unpredictability and humiliation. Despite participants' resilience, the process may have negative consequences for adolescent health. (c) 2018 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

TI  - A study of morbidity of induced abortion data from women belonging to Karachi, Pakistan
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the morbidity of induced abortion in relation to facilities, service providers and social responses of general population of women, from Karachi, Pakistan. Cross-sectional survey, conducted from February to December 2010, through a researcher-administered questionnaire from 61 randomly selected women, who underwent for Induced Abortion, aged 18-50 years. The questionnaire included open and closed ended questions, regarding demography, facilities, service providers and various complications observed. Overall, 98 immediate health problems were reported by 40 (65.5%) of the respondents, 153 late adverse effects or chronic by 46 (75.4%); while 101 mental complications had been reported by 45 (73.8%) of the 61 aborting women; respectively. Private clinics surfaced as the most frequently adopted source as reported by 40.7% of the respondents. Two third majorities had the procedure in satisfactory, good hygienic conditions by skilled professionals. Around 59% of the aborting women were aware of the religious perspective of the subject. Marked incidence of complications had been registered, regardless of type of method adopted, hygienic condition of the procedure or skill of the provider. Although, awareness of religious perspective of the subject was there, still quite a lot opted for abortion. This suggests that strong socioeconomic factors influence women to take peril of such an attempt. It also reveals the existence of a big gap for the awareness services for educating the risks involved to the women's health. Study revealed that services are easily accessible; without any legal, religious or social barriers. Semi or un-educated women, mostly from low socioeconomic sector are opting the procedure in majority, being less aware and stalwartly influenced by environmental factors; hence excessive availability of abortion services should be revisited. Lack of deep awareness of the consequences also contributes for deteriorating future reproductive and mental health. Awareness and counseling services for aborting women, for their health risks, as well as about human perspective of the issue, needs to be initiated, for better management of their reproductive health and rights.

TI  - Woman vs. Fetus: Frame Transformation and Intramovement Dynamics in the Pro-Life Movement
T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL SPECTRUM
AB  - What happens when insiders challenge a movement's dominant frame? To advance knowledge regarding how movement factions respond to frame transformation proposals, this paper examines an attempt to transform the central framing of the American pro-life movement. Over the past four decades, the American pro-life movement primarily employed a fetal rights frame. Yet a growing contingent of the pro-life movement is attempting to replace fetal-centric rhetoric with a frame claiming abortion is harmful to women. Using a combination of focus groups, interviews, and participant observation, this paper explains why this faction is challenging hegemonic pro-life framing and how more traditional pro-life actors respond. I argue that while ideological and organizational concerns often make transformation of a movement's central framing unlikely, if intramovement challengers can persuasively highlight the resonant appeal of challenging frames, movement colleagues are often willing to partially accommodate transformation requests by responding with frame extension.

TI  - Comparison of Health, Development, Maternal Bonding, and Poverty Among Children Born After Denial of Abortion vs After Pregnancies Subsequent to an Abortion
T2  - JAMA PEDIATRICS
AB  - IMPORTANCE Evidence indicates that there are potential health, development, and maternal bonding consequences for children born from unwanted pregnancies.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the association of women receiving or being denied a wanted abortion with their children's health and well-being.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 5-year longitudinal observational study with a quasi-experimental design conducted between January 18, 2008, and January 25, 2016, examined women who received abortions just under the gestational age limit of 30 abortion facilities across the United States and women who were denied abortion just beyond the gestational age limit in these facilities. Analyses compared the children of 146 women who were denied an abortion (index children) with children born to 182 women who received an abortion and had a subsequent child within 5 years (subsequent children). Interview-to-interview retention averaged 94.5%(6895 of 7293) across the 11 semi-annual interviews.
   EXPOSURES Being born after denial of abortion vs after a new pregnancy subsequent to an abortion.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Perinatal outcomes and child health, child development, maternal bonding, socioeconomics, and household structure.
   RESULTS This study included 328 women who had children during the study period (mean [SD] age at study recruitment, 23.7 [4.9] years). There were no differences by study group in consent to participate in the study, completion of first interview, or continuation in the study. Among the 328 children in the study (146 index children and 182 subsequent children), there were 163 girls and 165 boys. Perinatal and child health outcomes were not different between subsequent and index children, and there was no clear pattern of delayed child development. However, mixed-effects models adjusting for clustered recruitment and multiple observations per child revealed that poor maternal bonding was more common for index children compared with subsequent children (9% vs 3%; adjusted odds ratio, 5.14; 95% CI, 1.48-17.85). Index children lived in households with lower incomes relative to the federal poverty level than did subsequent children (101% vs 132% of federal poverty level; adjusted regression coefficient, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.52 to -0.10), and were more likely to live in households without enough money to pay for basic living expenses (72% vs 55%; adjusted odds ratio, 5.16; 95% CI, 2.34-11.40).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that access to abortion enables women to choose to have children at a time when they have more financial and emotional resources to devote to their children.

TI  - PREVIOUS STRESS AND ACUTE PSYCHOLOGICAL DEFENSE AS PREDICTORS OF PERINATAL GRIEF - AN EXPLORATORY-STUDY
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - We evaluated whether the emotional reactions of women at 2-6 weeks after the prenatal diagnosis of a lethal anomaly and at 3 months after perinatal loss might be predicted by previous stress and acute psychological defence reactions to the diagnosis. Previous stress was defined objectively as a history of major life event(s) and having received professional mental health treatment in the past, and subjectively as the disposition for feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. Forty-one women were interviewed and completed measures on their history of major life events, whether they had received professional mental health treatment in the past, inadequacy, acute psychological defence reactions and perinatal grief. Regression analyses showed that inadequacy was the most strongly positive predictor of perinatal grief shortly after receiving the unfavourable diagnosis and three months after perinatal loss. In addition to inadequacy, having received professional mental health treatment in the past led to significantly more intense grief, but only shortly after receiving the unfavourable diagnosis. Previous life events intensified grief three months after perinatal death. The grieving process was significantly moderated by the defence of 'principalization' while it was significantly intensified by 'turning aggression against oneself', but only shortly after receiving the unfavourable diagnosis.
   These effects were not contaminated by relationships with pregnancy-related variables. Our findings imply that psychological support for women with perinatal loss should particularly be offered to those who have been identified as generally anxious, who have reported previous major life events and have received professional mental health treatment in the past.

TI  - Threats during sex work and association with mental health among young female sex workers in Hong Kong
T2  - AIDS CARE-PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AIDS/HIV
AB  - Young female sex workers (YFSWs) are confronted with significant threats during sex work. The present cross-sectional study examined different levels of threats (i.e., threats to life and health, threats to humanity, threats to control of work and financial security, and the threats to future) experienced by 87 YFSWs (age 16-25) in Hong Kong, and identified their association with mental health (i.e., psychological well-being) together with other factors, including childhood trauma, self-efficacy, hope, and social support. Results showed that the participants encountered a significant number of threats. More than half reported that they had a condom removed by clients during sex (51.7%); or have been humililated by clients (51.7%). Because of sex work, about a quarter (25.3%) have had sexually transmitted disease, and respectively 10.3% and 12.6% have had abortion and unplanned pregnancy. The majority have had friends found out that they engaged in sex work (72.4%). They also showed a high level of worry about the various threats. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that childhood trauma (=-.26) and worry about threats during sex work (=-.22) were significantly negative predictors, while self-efficacy (=.20) and hope (=.27) were significantly positive predictors of mental health. Future services should improve YFSWs' skills to minimize potential threats during female sex work, address the structural correlates and relieve their worries, and empower them with more hope and self-efficacy in choosing clients.

TI  - Teen Motherhood and Long-Term Health Consequences
T2  - MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL
AB  - The objective of this article is to examine the association of teen motherhood and long-term physical and mental health outcomes. The physical and mental health components (PCS and MCS) of the SF-12 Healthy Survey in the NLSY79 health module were used to assess long-term health outcomes of women who experienced teenage motherhood. Various familial, demographic, and environmental characteristics were indentified and controlled for that may have predicted teen motherhood and long-term health outcomes. The two comparison groups for teen mothers were women who experienced teen-pregnancy only and women who were engaged in unprotected sexual activity as a teenage but did not experience pregnancy. Multivariate ordinary least squares regression was used for analysis. The average PCS and MCS for teen mothers was 49.91 and 50.89, respectively. Teen mothers exhibited poorer physical health later in life compared to all women as well as the comparison groups. When controlling for age, teen mothers had significantly lower PCS and MCS scores compared to all other women. Furthermore, when controlling for familial, demographic, and environmental characteristics, teen mothers exhibited significantly lower PCS and MCS scores. When comparing teen mothers to the two comparison groups, PCS was not statistically different although MCS was significantly lower in the teen-pregnancy group. Teen motherhood does lead to poorer physical health outcomes later in life. On the other hand, poorer mental health outcomes in later life may be attributed to the unmeasured factors leading to a teen pregnancy and not teen motherhood itself. Additional research needs to be conducted on the long-term consequences of teen motherhood.

TI  - Planning parenthood: the Affordable Care Act young adult provision and pathways to fertility
T2  - JOURNAL OF POPULATION ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper investigates the effect of the Affordable Care Act young adult provision on fertility and related outcomes. The expected effect of the provision on fertility is not clear ex ante. By expanding insurance coverage to young adults, the provision may affect fertility directly through expanded options for obtaining contraceptives as well as through expanded options for obtaining pregnancy-, birth-, and infant-related care, and these may lead to decreased or increased fertility, respectively. In addition, the provision may also affect fertility indirectly through marriage or labor markets, and the direction and magnitude of these effects is difficult to determine. This paper considers the effect of the provision on fertility as well as the contributing channels by applying difference-in-differences type methods using the 2008-2010 and 2012-2013 American Community Survey, 2006-2009 and 2012-2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention abortion surveillance data, and 2006-2010 and 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth. Results suggest that the provision is associated with decreases in the likelihood of having given birth and abortion rates and an increase in the likelihood of using long-term hormonal contraceptives.

TI  - Alcohol consumption, smoking, and drug use in pregnancy: Prevalence and risk factors in Southern Thailand
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Introduction Substance use during pregnancy contributes to the risk of adverse health outcomes in mothers and childrenin utero and during later development. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of substance use and associated factors in pregnant women receiving antenatal care in public hospitals in Thailand.
   Methods Women (3578) attending 7 antenatal care clinics in Songkhla for the first time during their current pregnancy were interviewed with a structured questionnaire focusing on demographic data, obstetric history, use of alcohol, tobacco, and other substances, and the General Health Questionnaire was administered. The use of substances was confirmed with the ultrarapid version of the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test and urine tests, which were also administered to 1 in 5 to 10 randomly selected women whose screening results were negative.
   Results Based on self-reports and General Health Questionnaire results, the weighted prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit substance use and that of mental health problems were 5.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.9-6.4) and 29.2% (95% CI, 27.5-30.9), respectively. On the basis of the ultrarapid version of the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test and urine tests, the prevalence of likely substance use disorder during the 3months prior to assessment was 1.2% (95% CI, 0.8-1.5) and 7.7% (95% CI, 4.6-10.7), respectively. Factors associated with substance use were religion, unmarried status, unplanned pregnancy, previous abortion, and current mental health problem.
   Discussion Our results emphasize the need for identification of substance use and mental health problems, with the help of questionnaires and biological markers, followed by early intervention.

TI  - Effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction on depression, anxiety, and stress of women with the early loss of pregnancy in southeast Iran: a randomized control trial
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Background The loss of the fetus may cause mental health problems in women. The present study aimed to determine the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on anxiety, depression, and stress in women with early pregnancy loss. Methods This study was performed on 106 women with early pregnancy loss in Shiraz, Iran. The intervention group underwent eight counselling sessions. Pre-test and post-test were performed in both groups with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS) 21 questionnaire. Data were analyzed by SPSS 23. Results There was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores in the intervention group vs. the control group in terms of anxiety (7.9 +/- 1.07 vs. 13.79 +/- 5.36, respectively), stress (9.26 +/- 1.25 vs.18.13 +/- 7.66, respectively), and depression (7.83 +/- 1.05 vs.16.26 +/- 11.06, respectively) (P < 0.0001). ConclusionsMBSR can be suggested to promote women's mental health. Plain language summary Women who lose their pregnancies are more at risk than others for mental disorders such as anxiety, depression, and grief. Assessing stress, anxiety, and depression is critical to maintain women's overall health so that timely supportive interventions can be pursued if necessary. Eight MBSR intervention sessions were performed for 53 women with early pregnancy loss. The total intervention for all participants took 4 months. Results showed that the anxiety, depres-sion, and stress of most participants decreased, which suggests that MBSR can be an effective non-pharmacological method to improve mental health.

TI  - Prenatal depression and stress - risk factors for placental pathology and spontaneous abortion
T2  - ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY AND EMBRYOLOGY
AB  - Prenatal stress and depression affects 10-25% of pregnant women and is associated with disruption of fetal neurodevelopment, higher rates of placental abnormalities, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, or preterm birth. Markers of genetic vulnerability are catechol-O-methyltransferase, monoamine oxidase-A, variation of serotonin transporters, low levels of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, and brain derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met (BDNF), while hyperactivity of HPA (hypothalamic pituitary adrenal) axis and massive release of endogenous cortisol, regulated by metalloproteinase-1, -2, -3 and -9, and are involved both in depressive symptoms and neurodevelopmental abnormalities in fetus. In women with prenatal stress and depression which suffered spontaneous abortion were observed placental abnormalities as regular shape and necrotic villi, decidua with large areas of necrosis, acute inflammation and effusion areas correlated with increase in proinflammatory factors, immune deficit and infections, hyaline type fibrosis, intervilos and deciduous intense hemorrhage, associated with increase of vascular endothelial growth factor. Taking into account the important societal and economic costs becomes important for an interdisciplinary approach, in which pregnancy and its risks are a central point for women mental health.

TI  - Psychologic Sequelae in Early Pregnancy Complications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Early pregnancy complications, including miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and hyperemesis gravidarum, are common discomforts accounting for about 15% to 20% of all pregnancies. A proportion of women with early pregnancy complications will experience short-and long-term psychologic sequelae in the aftermath of pregnancy complications, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which are the most commonly reported psychologic reactions. This review will focus on the course and impact of these psychologic sequelae in early pregnancy complications, and the noninvasive interventions to improve mental health are also briefly discussed.

TI  - Prevalence and factors associated with depression among pregnant mothers in the West Shoa zone, Ethiopia: a community-based cross-sectional study
T2  - ANNALS OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background Depression during pregnancy, the most prevalent mental health problem, can alter fetal development and has important consequences on the offspring's physical and mental health. Evidence suggests increasing rates of prevalence of depression in low-income settings such as Ethiopia. However, there are a few studies on the topic with inconsistent results. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of antenatal depression and its correlates among pregnant women in Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the West Shoa zone, Oromia regional state, Ethiopia, from February 20, 2018, to March 20, 2018. Pregnant women were recruited by using cluster sampling techniques. Data on socio-demographic, obstetric, and psychosocial characteristics were collected by interviewer-administered questionnaire. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression during pregnancy. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were fitted to identify correlates of depression. The level of statistical significance was declared at p value < 0.05. Results The mean age (+/- SD) of the pregnant women was 28.41 +/- 5.9 years. The prevalence of depression during pregnancy was 32.3%. When we adjusted for possible confounding variables in the final model; those pregnant mothers with an average monthly income of less than 500 (18 USD) Ethiopian birr [AOR = 3.19, 95% CI (1.47, 6.96)], unplanned pregnancy [AOR = 1.52, 95% CI (1.04, 2.21)] and having history of abortion [AOR = 5.13, 95% CI (2.42, 10.85)] have higher odds of depression when compared to their counterparts. Conclusion The prevalence of depression during pregnancy was high. Strengthening the counseling service as well as increasing access and availability of modern contraceptive methods may reduce the rates of unplanned pregnancy in Ethiopia and this, in turn, plays a significant role in alleviating a resultant depression. Further, the integration of mental health services with existing maternal health care as well as strengthening the referral system among public health centers was warranted to minimize antenatal depression in the West Shoa zone health facilities.

TI  - Health of Children Born Through Artificial Oocyte Activation: A Pilot Study
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Artificial oocyte activation (AOA) has shown to improve fertility in severe male infertility following intracytoplasmic sperm insemination (ICSI). However, the effect of AOA on the health status of children has not been studied. This pilot historical cohort study aims to evaluate physical and mental health of 79 and 89 children from 275 and 406 couples undergoing ICSI-AOA using ionomycin and conventional ICSI, respectively. The outcomes assessed were clinical pregnancy, abortion, type of delivery, and health of children (major birth defect, mental and behavior status). No significant differences were observed between the ICSI-AOA and the ICSI groups for these parameters, and the rate of major birth defects were not significantly different between the 2 groups. In this study, AOA has not imposed a greater risk on physical and mental health of children born through AOA, but for such a solid conclusion, further trails with higher number of cases are required and conclusions drawn are limited to this study.

TI  - Emotional responses and perceived stressors of frontline medical staffs in case of COVID-19 treatment centers and obstetrics emergency in Ethiopia
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background the rapid spread of COVID-19, its lethality in severe cases and the absence of specific medicine poses a huge threat to human life and health, as well as huge impact on the mental health. Facing this critical situation, health care workers on the front line who are directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms including emotional disturbance. Objective the aim of this study will be to assess the current state of emotional responses and perceived stressors of frontline medical staffs in case of Addis Ababa COVID-19 Treatment Centers and obstetrics emergency and abortion care, Ethiopia 2020. Methods Hospital based comparative cross-section study design was conducted by using self-administered questionnaire survey from June 1st to 30th of 2020 among 133 and 266 frontline medical staffs from obstetric emergency and abortion care clinic and COVID-19 treatment centers respectively. The data were collected after getting written consent from each participant and it entered into the computer using Epi-data version 7, then exported to SPSS version 20 for further analysis. Descriptive analysis was done using frequencies & percent. All independent determinants with P-value < 0.05 were used to identify important predictors of emotional responses and perceived stressors. Result A total of 399 frontline medical staffs were included in the study. The mean age of the respondents of those who were working in obstetrics emergency and abortion care clinic was 27.47 (SD, 3.46) years and it was 28.12 (SD, 4.09) years for the other groups. This study revealed that, 72.9 and 5.6% of the study participant from obstetrics emergency and abortion clinic and COVID-19 treatment centers had a positive emotional response, respectively. Factors such as having a low level of motivational factors (AOR 2.78, 95% CI (1.13, 6.84)), being a nurse (AOR 10.53, 95% CI (1.31, 85.26)) and working at triage (AOR 8.61, 95% CI (1.15, 64.81))) had statistically significant association with negative emotional response. Conclusion The current study revealed that a high proportion of front line a negative emotional responses had negative emotional response. Further, almost all of the medical staffs working in COVID-19 treatment centers and at obstetrics emergency and abortion care unit had perceived the outbreak related stressors. So, providing comprehensive psychological support is warranted for health care providers working in such kinds of department or units.

TI  - Respondent-driven sampling to assess mental health outcomes, stigma and acceptance among women raising children born from sexual violence-related pregnancies in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives: Assess mental health outcomes among women raising children from sexual violence-related pregnancies (SVRPs) in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and stigma toward and acceptance of women and their children.
   Design: Participants were recruited using respondent-driven sampling.
   Setting: Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo in 2012.
   Participants: 757 adult women raising children from SVRPs were interviewed. A woman aged 18 and older was eligible for the study if she self-identified as a sexual violence survivor since the start of the conflict (similar to 1996), conceived an SVRP, delivered a liveborn child and was currently raising the child. A woman was ineligible for the study if the SVRP ended with a spontaneous abortion or fetal demise or the child was not currently living or in the care of the biological mother.
   Intervention: Trained female Congolese interviewers verbally administered a quantitative survey after obtaining verbal informed consent.
   Outcome measures: Symptom criteria for major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and suicidality were assessed, as well as stigma toward the woman and her child. Acceptance of the woman and child from the spouse, family and community were analysed.
   Results: 48.6% met symptom criteria for major depressive disorder, 57.9% for post-traumatic stress disorder, 43.3% for anxiety and 34.2% reported suicidality. Women who reported stigma from the community (38.4%) or who reported stigma toward the child from the spouse (42.9%), family (31.8%) or community (38.1%) were significantly more likely to meet symptom criteria for most mental health disorders. Although not statistically significant, participants who reported acceptance and acceptance of their children from the spouse, family and community were less likely to meet symptom criteria.
   Conclusions: Women raising children from SVRPs experience symptoms of mental health disorders. Programming addressing stigma and acceptance following sexual violence may improve mental health outcomes in this population.

TI  - The preconception stress and mental health of couples
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - The ultimate goal of the 'baby plan' is a healthy pregnancy and successful child rearing. El Focusing on baby planning, this article covers issues concerning a successful and healthy pregnancy with a psychiatric point of view-the stress and mental health before the pregnancy. According to recent findings, stress influences a women's infertility rate 10 to 15 percent, and a major psychological reason is found to be depression rather than anxiety disorder. The infertility of men is also influenced by stress, based on the research findings that the density and quality of sperm worsens after disasters. Excessive stress before and during pregnancy could result in pre-term labor, small for gestational age infants, or reduced infant weight. In order to prevent these preconception distresses, psychiatric care and treatment are needed. In this regard, Eastern traditional wisdom could be helpful in the view of psychotherapy, since it has been traditionally approved and welcomed for more than a thousand years. One of the insights is that a sound relationship between a husband and wife is a foundation of a good family, and this has already been determined from the moment when the two met for the first time. In conclusion, preconception stress could negatively influence fertility and could have a negative effect on a pregnancy. Thus stress should be alieviated for a healthy pregnancy and successful child rearing by psychotherapeutic intervention.

TI  - Therapeutic termination of pregnancy and major psychiatric outcomes in parents
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
AB  - Objectives: Therapeutic termination of pregnancy (TToP) may have psychiatric outcomes like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic-stress disorder (PTSD). Material and methods: 45 couples had psychiatric evaluation before TToP and after one-year period. Results: TToP is linked to acute development of depressive symptoms that recover with time and professional support. Twelve percent of women developed PTSD (but 29.5% refused one-year evaluation due to mental distress at recalling TToP). Fathers showed no psychiatric outcomes. Conclusions: Acute depressive symptoms after TToP improve with professional support but PTSD rate is con-cerning and stress importance of mental health implications and need for adequate related treatments.

TI  - Options Counseling for the Pregnant Adolescent Patient
T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - Although teenage pregnancy rates have decreased over the past 30 years, many adolescents become pregnant every year. It is important for pediatricians to have the ability and the resources to make a timely pregnancy diagnosis in their adolescent patients and provide them with nonjudgmental counseling that includes the full range of pregnancy options. Counseling includes an unbiased discussion of the adolescent's options to continue or terminate the pregnancy, supporting the adolescent in the decision-making process, and referring the adolescent to appropriate resources and services. It is important for pediatricians to be familiar with laws and policies impacting access to abortion care, especially for minor adolescents, as well as laws that seek to limit health care professionals' provision of unbiased pregnancy options counseling and referrals, either for abortion care or continuation of pregnancy in accordance with the adolescent's choice. Pediatricians who choose not to provide such discussions should promptly refer pregnant adolescent patients to a health care professional who will offer developmentally appropriate pregnancy options counseling that includes the full range of pregnancy options. Pediatricians should be aware of and oppose policies that restrict their ability to provide pregnant adolescents with unbiased counseling that includes the full range of pregnancy options. This approach to pregnancy options counseling has not changed since the original 1989 American Academy of Pediatrics statement on this issue.

TI  - Adolescent childbirth, miscarriage, and abortion: associations with changes in alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background Adolescent girls who become pregnant demonstrate greater risk for substance use than same-aged peers. However, it remains unclear how risk relates to normative changes in adolescence. Few studies have examined adolescent substance use changes before, during, and after pregnancy and considered how pregnancy outcomes (childbirth, miscarriage, abortion) differentially influence substance use changes. The present study examined associations between different adolescent pregnancy outcomes and within-person changes in substance use from prepregnancy to postpregnancy. Methods Participants included 2,450 girls (52% Black) oversampled from low-income urban neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, PA. Participants self-reported pregnancy outcomes and substance use frequency (alcohol, cigarette, marijuana) annually from ages 11-20. Fixed effects regressions focused on first births, first miscarriages, and first abortions occurring from ages 12-19 to test the associations between pregnancy outcomes and within-individual changes in substance use from prepregnancy to postpregnancy. By design, models controlled for all potential time-stable confounds, and models included age and subsequent pregnancies as time-varying covariates. Results Consistent with prior studies, girls who became pregnant (20%) reported greater early risk for substance use problems than never-pregnant adolescents, including earlier age of onset and more regular marijuana and cigarette use. Childbirth predicted a 26%-51% within-individual reduction in alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use that remained significantly lower than prepregnancy levels after childbirth. Alcohol and marijuana use decreased (32%-47%) after miscarriage. Abortion was not associated with long-term changes in substance use; however, marijuana and cigarette use gradually increased (44%-46%) in the years leading up to the year of and after abortion, respectively, before returning to prepregnancy levels. Conclusions Findings highlight important differences in adolescent substance use patterns based on pregnancy outcome. For pregnant adolescents with heightened pre-existing risk for substance use, pregnancy may be a window of opportunity for substance use screening and behavioral intervention.

TI  - Shoutai Wan regulates glycolysis imbalance at the maternal-fetal interface in threatened abortion mice
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Threatened abortion is a common disease among women of childbearing age. Its high incidence rate and unclear etiology, seriously threaten women's physical and mental health. Shoutai Wan (STW) is a traditional Chinese medicine decoction for treating abortion. It has a long history of treating threatened abortion by tonifying the kidney and calming the fetus. However, the mechanism of STW remains unclear. Aim of study: To study the mechanism and potential benefit of STW in pregnant mice with hydrocortisone and mifepristone-induced threatened abortion. Materials and methods: The STW compounds were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. STW-H, STW-M, or STW-L was separately given 3 mg/ml, 1.5 mg/ml and 0.75 mg/ml STW in the morning, and 2 mg/ml hydrocortisone in the afternoon from gestation day (D) 1-9 and once with 0.4 mg/kg mifepristone on D10. Didroxyprogesterone (0.1 mg/ml) and equal dose pure water were used to replace STW in didroxyprogesterone (DYD) group and model group respectively. The control group used pure water to replace STW, hydrocortisone, and mifepristone. We performed morphological and histological analyses of the maternalfetal interface on day 10. Results: The embryo loss rate in the STW-H and DYD groups was lower than that in the model group. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining suggested that the morphology of maternal-fetal interface was improved in the STW-H and DYD groups. Immunohistochemical (IHC), Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reactionstaining (qRT-PCR), and Western blot (WB) results indicated that HIF-1 alpha expression in the maternal-fetal interface of the STW-H and DYD groups was higher than that in model group. The activities of HK, PKM, LDH and the concentration of lactic acid in the STW-H and DYD groups were higher than those in model group. Furthermore, the protein and mRNA levels of HK2, PKM2, LDHA, MCT4, and GPR81 were higher in the STW-H and DYD groups than those in the model group. Conclusions: STW can reduce the pregnancy loss rate by regulating the glycolysis balance at the maternal-fetal interface of kidney deficiency threatened abortion model mice.

TI  - The effect of voluntary termination of pregnancy on female sexual and emotional well-being in different age groups
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: To evaluate the impact of voluntary termination of pregnancy (VTOP) on the psycho-sexological well-being of females before/six months after the abortion.Methods: A sample of 194 women was recruited from three obstetrics and gynaecological divisions. The women were evaluated for the variables sexual functioning with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), depression with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and anxiety state with the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) at time 0 (the beginning of the abortion procedure) and time 1 (six months after the abortion). Since 24 women refused to fill out the questionnaires, the final sample was composed of 170 women.Results: The women showed a slight although significant improvement in the mean FSFI score from time 0 (16.712.9) to time 1 (20.9 +/- 13.8) (p<0.001) which paralleled with a slight decrease in the incidence of clinically significant sexual dysfunction [49% (84/170) (time 0) versus 34.1% (58/170) (time 1)], (McNemar's test; p=0.0241). The sub-group of younger women (18-25) showed a lesser increase in FSFI score from time 0 to time 1. In addition, both depression (p=0.048) and anxiety (p<0.001) significantly decreased over time. However, the female sexuality remained impaired since more than two thirds (69.5%) of women were sexually dysfunctional six months after VTOP.Discussion: Voluntary TOP may influence the sexuality of younger females differently from how it influences that of older women. Hence, the sexuality of younger female should be regularly supervised in follow-up examinations.

TI  - Help-seeking Following Termination of Pregnancy after Diagnosis of Fetal Anomaly: Women's Intentions and Experiences 1 to 7 Years after the Event
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
AB  - Introduction Diagnosis of fetal anomaly and the difficult circumstances involved in the decision to terminate an affected pregnancy can go along with severe psychological distress. However, little is known about women's help-seeking for emotional problems following an abortion after diagnosis of fetal anomaly.
   Methods 148 women who had been treated for abortion after diagnosis of fetal anomaly at the University Hospital Leipzig responded to self-report questionnaires 1 to 7 years after the event. Main outcomes were help-seeking intentions and actual help-seeking behavior. Logistic regression was used to explore the associations between participants' sociodemographic characteristics and help-seeking intentions.
   Results Most women reported that they would seek help from their partner (91.7%), friends/family (82.8%) or the internet (62.2%). With regard to health services, 50.0% of women would seek help from gynecologists and between 43.8 and 47.9% from counseling services and mental health professionals. Intentions to seek help from support groups were lowest (21.7%). Age, income, region, and religion were associated with help-seeking intentions. Among participants with elevated levels of current psychological distress, 23.8% indicated that they had not discussed their emotional problems with a health service ever.
   Conclusion Gynecologists are among the most preferred health professionals for women to discuss psychological problems in the aftermath of an abortion after diagnosis of fetal anomaly. They should be actively involved in screening, diagnostic assessment, and referral of affected women.

TI  - Maternal suicide in Italy
T2  - ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Suicide has been identified as one of the most common causes of death among women within 1 year after the end of pregnancy in several high-income countries. The aim of this study was to provide the first estimate of the maternal suicide ratio and a description of the characteristics of women who died by suicide during pregnancy or within 1 year after giving birth, induced abortion or miscarriage (i.e., maternal suicide) in 10 Italian regions, covering 77% of total national births. Maternal suicides were identified through the linkage between regional death registries and hospital discharge databases. Background population data was collected from the national hospital discharge, abortion and mortality databases. The previous psychiatric history of the women who died by maternal suicide was retrieved from the regionally available data sources. A total of 67 cases of maternal suicide were identified, corresponding to a maternal suicide ratio of 2.30 per 100,000 live births in 2006-2012. The suicide rate was 1.18 per 100,000 after giving birth (n = 2,876,193), 2.77 after an induced abortion (n = 650,549) and 2.90 after a miscarriage (n = 379,583). The majority of the women who died by maternal suicide (34/57) had a previous psychiatric history; 15/18 previously diagnosed mental disorders were not registered along with the index pregnancy obstetric records. Suicide is a relevant cause of maternal death in Italy. The continuity of care between primary, mental health and maternity care were found to be critical. Clinicians should be aware of the issue, as they may play an important role in preventing suicide in their patients.

TI  - The health response to the Rohingya refugee crisis post August 2017: Reflections from two years of health sector coordination in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - On August 25 2017, an unprecedented influx of Rohingya refugees began from Rakhine State in Myanmar into Bangladesh's district of Cox's Bazar. The scale and acuteness of this humanitarian crisis was unprecedented and unique globally, requiring strong coordination of a multitude of actors. This paper reflects on the health sector coordination from August 2017 to October 2019, focusing on selected achievements and persisting challenges of the health sector strategic advisory group (HSSAG), and the health sector working groups including epidemiology and case management, sexual and reproductive health, community health, mental health and psychosocial support, and emergency preparedness. In the early days of the response, minimum service standards for primary health care were established, a fundamental initial step which enabled the standardization of services based on critical needs. Similarly, establishing standards for community health outreach was the backbone for capitalizing on this important health workforce. Novel approaches were adopted for infectious disease responses for acute watery diarrhoea and varicella, drawing on inter-sectoral collaborations. Sexual and reproductive health services were prioritized from the initial onset of the crisis and improvements in skilled delivery attendance, gender-based violence services, abortion care and family planning were recorded. Mental health service provision was strengthened through community-based approaches although integration of mental health programmes into primary health care has been limited by availability of specialist psychiatrists. Strong, collaborative and legitimate leadership by the health sector strategic advisory group, drawing on inter-sectoral collaborations and the technical expertise of the different technical working groups, were critical in the response and proved effective, despite the remaining challenges to be addressed. Anticipated reductions in funding as the crisis moves into protracted status threatens the achievements of the health sector in provision of health services to the Rohingya refugees.

TI  - Impact of unintended pregnancy on maternal mental health: a causal analysis using follow up data of the Panel Study on Korean Children (PSKC)
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB  - Background: Pregnancy intention is important for maternal and child health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the causal relation between pregnancy intention and maternal depression and parenting stress in Korean women who gave birth during 2008.
   Methods: This study is a retrospective evaluation of prospectively collected data from the Panel Study on Korean Children from 2008 to 2010. Causal analyses were conducted using propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighted methods. In addition, mediation analyses were performed to test mitigating effects of marital conflict, fathers' participation in childcare, and mothers' knowledge of infant development on the relation between unintended pregnancy and adverse maternal mental health.
   Results: Results showed that the overall effect of an unintended pregnancy on maternal depression and parenting stress was statistically significant. An unintended pregnancy was associated with 20-22% greater odds of maternal depression, 0.28-0.39 greater depression score, and 0.85-1.16 greater parenting stress score. Relations between pregnancy intention and maternal depression, maternal depression score and parenting stress score were moderately explained by marital conflict and fathers' participation in childcare.
   Conclusions: Unintended pregnancy contributed to increased risks of maternal depression and parenting stress. Efforts to increase fathers' participation in childcare and decrease marital conflict might be helpful to mitigate adverse impacts of unintended pregnancy on perinatal maternal mental health.

TI  - Effects of COVID-19 Epidemic Lockdown on Postpartum Depressive Symptoms in a Sample of Italian Mothers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - The extraordinary health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic represents a new challenge for mental health researchers and clinical practitioners. The related containment measures may be a risk factor for psychological distress and mood disorders, especially in at-risk populations. This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on postpartum depressive symptoms in mothers with children below 1 year of age. An online questionnaire survey was therefore conducted in Italy between May and June 2020. The survey consisted of several self-administered questionnaires: besides some ad-hoc questionnaires, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Scale of Perceived Social Support (SPSS) and the Maternity Social Support Scale (MSSS) were used. Two hundred forty-three Italian women were included in the study. The prevalence of postpartum depression symptomatology among mothers was 44%, as measured through the EPDS (cut-off >12). Women who spent the isolation in northern Italy adopted maladaptive coping strategies significantly more than women living in areas at lower risk. The analysis highlighted a significant difference between the group that was not directly affected by the virus and women who have had a direct or indirect contact with it. Besides situational factors specific to the pandemic, the results show that there are some risk factors tied to the personal history of the mother (e.g., having had a previous abortion). These data should inform and enlighten future protocols of intervention.

TI  - The Changing Face of Feticide in Multiple Pregnancies
T2  - ISSUES IN LAW & MEDICINE
AB  - The selective termination of one or more fetuses in higher order multiple pregnancies began in the 1980s in response to the increased rate of multiples arising from assisted reproductive technology (ART). Multifetal Pregnancy Reduction (MFPR) was justified by improving outcomes for the remaining offspring and their mother, and while the evidence suggests prematurity and the morbidity associated with it are reduced, there is a cost in increased miscarriage and mortality. As perinatal care has advanced, the margins of improvement have narrowed and hence the cost/benefit ratio. At the same time, MFPR has morphed from a rare procedure undertaken for quadruplets and higher, to one in which triplets and twins are increasingly reduced to a singleton, and more so for social reasons. This review considers the evidence for MFPR's efficacy and risks, along with those changes over time. Notably absent is research on the surviving children or the ongoing physical and mental health of mothers. The ethical reasoning used by practitioners and others is also explored, as is the culture of ART and abortion that drive the practice.

TI  - Exploring risk factors for suicidal ideation in a population-based sample of New Zealand women who have experienced intimate partner violence
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objective: To explore factors associated with suicidal thoughts among women who had experienced intimate partner violence (IPV), using data from the New Zealand replication of the WHO Multi-country Violence Against Women study. Method: Face-to-face interviews were conducted. A population-based cluster sampling scheme with a fixed number of dwellings per cluster was employed. Logistic regression was conducted to identify those variables independently associated with suicidal ideation. Results: Women who had experienced IPV were more likely to report they had thought about taking their own life if they: reported that their partner's behaviour had impacted on their mental health (OR = 4.81, 95% CI 3.30-7.01); were current or former users of recreational drugs (OR=1.94, 95% CI 1.43-2.64); had experienced a stillbirth/abortion/miscarriage (OR=1.93, 95% CI 1.44-2.58); and had experienced emotional abuse in the previous 12 months (OR=1.40, 95% CI 1.00-1.96). Conclusion and Implications: This study corroborates international findings that women's experience of IPV is associated with increased risk of suicidal thoughts. While the results point to the need for all health care providers to routinely enquire about intimate partner violence among their patients, they also argue for the need for health care providers to be aware of, and equipped to respond to, the mental health needs of their clients. The results also indicate that there is a need for mental health services to assess for, and respond to intimate partner violence among women presenting with suicidal ideation.

TI  - Public attitude towards restrictions on persons with mental illness in greater Hanoi area, Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background and Aims: In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the need to protect human rights in psychiatry. Within the last years, considerable effort has been made to reduce restrictive measures in mental health settings. Reducing restrictive measures within mental health care has also moved increasingly into the focus of public debate. This study aims, for the first time in a Southeast Asian sample, to explore whether socio-demographic factors affect public attitudes toward restrictions on mentally ill people in Hanoi, Vietnam.
   Methods: A general population-based survey (self-report questionnaire) was carried out in 2013 in the greater Hanoi area. The survey sample (N=813) was recruited according to the latest published census (2009) and micro-census (2013) in Vietnam and Hanoi with regard to the socio-demographic factors gender, age, urbanity, household size and marital status. Multinomial logistic regressions for odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to examine the influence of epidemiological variables, like gender and age, on the public attitude toward restrictions imposed on mentally ill people in Vietnam.
   Results: This study found, for the first time in a large Vietnamese sample, that gender and age were associated with public attitudes toward restrictions on mentally ill people. In detail, significantly fewer men endorsed compulsory admission to a hospital and abortion than Vietnamese women. In addition, endorsement of abortion was significantly higher in older people.
   Conclusion: The results offer some insight into roles of women in the Vietnamese society and might reflect the traditional gender expectations in Vietnamese families. Moreover, the results emphasize the need for supporting female psychiatric patients and their families within their communities and in the Vietnamese society.

TI  - Incidence of female suicide in New York City: how important are socioeconomic factors?
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - PurposeAfter a steady decline in the incidence of suicide in the last 3 decades of the twentieth century, suicide rates in the US and likewise in New York City (NYC) began to rise. A breakdown of the city's rates by gender reveals that since 2000, suicides among men had held steady while the rate among women had increased in every age group, in divergence from the national pattern of rising rates in both genders. This study considers a broad range of socioeconomic variables to identify those most strongly associated with suicide rates of women in NYC.MethodDrawing on 4 decades of data from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Vital Statistics and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, we use an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to estimate short and long run relationships between suicide rates in women aged 15-44 and a range of socioeconomic factors.ResultsWe find a positive aggregate association between women's suicide rates and the unemployment rate, the White percentage of the city's population, the number of forcible rapes reported in the crime statistics, and a negative association between suicide and abortion rates.ConclusionsThe results of the study suggest that labor market conditions, rather than societal factors such as marriage or fertility rates affect younger women's suicide rates in NYC. Second, sexual violence against women, found in micro studies to have severe long-term negative effects on victims' mental health is also positively associated with the aggregate suicide rate. Finally, higher abortion rates correspond with lower suicide rates at the city level, but the mechanisms behind this link are not as clear, since micro studies find little association between unwanted pregnancy termination and mental health.

TI  - A survey of postpartum depression and health care needs among Chinese postpartum women during the pandemic of COVID-19
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRIC NURSING
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic seriously endangers the public?s mental health, especially to pregnant and postpartum women. But little is known about postpartum depression and health care needs among Chinese postpartum women. Aim: To investigate the status and risk factors of postpartum depression and health care needs among Chinese postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 209 Chinese postpartum women were recruited from May to July 2020 by convenience sampling and assessed online with self-designed Maternal General Information Questionnaire, Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) and Chinese Version of the Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS). Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis. Results: With the EPDS cut-off value of 10, the incidence of postpartum depressive symptoms was 56.9%. Age, history of abortion and perceived stress were the influencing factors of postpartum depression (adjusted R2 = 0.432, F = 23.611, p < .001). The top three health care needs were infant rearing guidance (78.0%), maternal and infant protection guidance (60.3%) and dietary guidance (45.0%). The proportion of psychological rehabilitation guidance needs in the depressed group was significantly higher than that in the non-depressed group (34.5% vs. 20.0%, p < .05). Conclusions: Maternal postpartum depression in China was at a high level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women aged 25?34, with a history of abortion and high stress levels were at higher risk for postpartum depression. Timely psychological counselling, intervention and COVID-19-related health education are in great need for postpartum women.

TI  - Reproductive health in lesbian and bisexual women in Sweden
T2  - ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Objective. Previous international studies have elucidated signs of poor physical and mental health in women who have sex with women (WSW) and an avoidance of preventive healthcare. When the first Nordic gynecological clinic for WSW was started in Stockholm in 1999, an opportunity to compile information about their physical and psychological health and social situation arose. Design. Retrospective descriptive. Setting and sample. A total of 706 women: 264 patients attending a WSW clinic and 442 women attending the regular gynecological clinic. Methods. Questionnaires. Response rate: WSW 77%, comparison group 40%. Main outcome measures. Possible differences in mental and reproductive health and attendance of preventive healthcare by WSW and heterosexual women. Results. Having had a male sexual partner was reported by 82.3% of the WSW, 39.5% in the last five years and 4.9% in the last year. One-fifth of WSW had been pregnant, and one in ten had given birth. Equally, many had experience of induced abortion. WSW had less experience of gynecological examination and Papanicolaou smear screening. More than one-fifth of WSW had at some time had sexually transmitted infections (STI) and 12.6% reported a history of cervical atypia. WSW remembered dissatisfaction with their sexual lives during their youth and had more frequently sought professional help for their sexuality. Conclusion. WSW attend gynecological examinations to a lesser extent than heterosexual women. The fact that WSW reported having been affected by STI and cervical cell atypia underlines the opinion that they should be advised to attend the same gynecological check-ups and cervical screening programs as heterosexual women.

TI  - Termination of pregnancy: Cultural practices, the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act and the constitutional rights of children
T2  - SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - The cultural practice of ukuthwala, the abduction for marriage of young girls, violates their constitutional rights and contravenes the Children's and Sexual Offences Act. The provisions of the Choice Act for the third trimester of pregnancy are more onerous than the former Abortion Act and violate the constitutional rights of girls and women who face a serious threat to their physical or mental health or have been raped or subjected to incest. The Choice Act should be amended accordingly. Until it is amended, healthcare practitioners should use the constitutional 'best interests of the child' principle as interpreted by the Children's Act when deciding whether or not to terminate the pregnancy of a child in the third trimester.

TI  - Pregnancy Outcomes in Maternal Neuropsychiatric Illness and Substance Abuse
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
AB  - Introduction Worldwide the prevalence of neuropsychiatric illness among women of reproductive age is higher than ever before. This study investigates the influences of maternal substance abuse/dependence and neuropsychiatric illness on pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Patients and Methods Using a retrospective study design 185 pregnancies in women with neuropsychiatric illnesses or substance abuse were identified at a single centre over a period of 3.25 years and compared to 4907 pregnancies in healthy women without mental illness. Differences in pre-, peri- and postnatal pregnancy parameters were studied. Results Numbers of previous abortions on obstetric history were significantly higher in cases compared to controls, women with depression being especially affected. The number of antenatal visits was also higher among cases, especially in women with depression. The caesarean section rate was significantly higher in cases compared to controls. Children of women with neuropsychiatric illness were born at lower gestational ages than those of healthy control mothers, however there were no significant differences between case and control groups for birth weight, head circumference or Apgar scores. Some isolated differences were found for disease-specific case subgroups compared to controls. Conclusion The study shows a relationship between maternal neuropsychiatric illness and pregnancy outcomes independent of medication use. Rates of spontaneous abortion were higher. Children were born earlier, yet the neonatal outcomes birth weight, head circumference and Apgar score were not worse than children of mentally healthy women.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF SEX RATIOS ON SUICIDE
T2  - HEALTH ECONOMICS
AB  - Whereas sex ratios are likely to affect the likelihood of marriage, how sex ratios affect health and survival is underexplored. This study uses suicide as a measure of mental health and examines how suicides are affected by sex ratios. As women tend to marry men older than themselves, shrinking populations will lead to higher sex ratios (i.e., higher proportions of men) in the marriage market. Using data from Japan, I find that high sex ratios, both early-life and current, are correlated with higher male suicide rates, whereas female suicide rates are generally not affected. The results of this study have important implications for public health in countries where imbalanced sex ratios are a concern. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Association of State Gestational Age Limit Abortion Laws With Infant Mortality
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: A growing number of state legislatures have passed laws that restrict access to abortion care after a specified gestational age (gestational age limit laws). The impact of these laws on maternal and child population health outcomes and inequities is unknown. The objective of this study is to determine whether states that implement gestational age limit laws experience subsequent changes in rates of infant mortality.
   Methods: Using U.S. population.based data from the National Center for Health Statistics Linked Infant Birth-Death Files (2005-2017), difference-in-differences models were estimated using multivariable linear regressions to compare the trends in infant mortality (all-cause and cause-specific rates) in states with gestational age limit laws with the trends in states without such laws. Models stratified by maternal racial/ethnic group explored racial heterogeneity in the law's impact. Data were analyzed in 2020.
   Results: This study included 16,232,133 births in states that enacted a gestation age limit abortion law and 36,472,309 births in states that did not from 2005 to 2017. In difference-in-difference analyses, gestational age limit laws were associated with 0.23 excess infant deaths per 1,000 live births (95% CI=0.09, 0.37, p<0.01). In cause-specific analyses, gestational age limit laws were associated with 0.10 additional infant deaths owing to congenital anomalies per 1,000 live births (95% CI=0.03, 0.17, p=0.01). Associations between gestational age limit laws and infant mortality in models stratified by maternal racial/ethnic group were not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: On the basis of data from 2005 to 2017, states that enacted gestational age limit abortion laws subsequently experienced increased infant mortality rates. (C) 2021 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Towards individualised contraceptive counselling: clinical and reproductive factors associated with self-reported hormonal contraceptive-induced adverse mood symptoms
T2  - BMJ SEXUAL & REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Objective The study aim was to establish which demographic, clinical, reproductive and psychiatric factors are associated with self-reported hormonal contraceptive (HC)-induced adverse mood symptoms. Study design We compiled baseline data from two Swedish studies: one cross-sectional study on combined oral contraceptive (COC)-induced adverse mood symptoms (n=118) and one randomised controlled trial on adverse mood symptoms on COC (n=184). Both included women eligible for COC use, aged over 18 years. All women answered a questionnaire on HC use and associated mood problems. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) was used to capture mood and anxiety disorders. Women who acknowledged HC-induced adverse mood symptoms, ongoing or previously (n=145), were compared with women without any such experience (n=157). Results Compared with women without self-reported HC-induced adverse mood symptoms, women with these symptoms were younger at HC start (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), had more often undergone induced abortion (OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.57 to 7.23), more often suffered from an ongoing minor depressive disorder (n=12 vs n=0) and had more often experienced any previous mental health problem (aOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.59). Conclusions In line with previous research, this study suggests that women with previous or ongoing mental health problems and women who are younger at HC start are more likely to experience HC-induced adverse mood symptoms. Former and current mental health should be addressed at contraceptive counselling, and ongoing mental health disorders should be adequately treated. Implications This study adds valuable knowledge for identification of women susceptible to HC-induced adverse mood symptoms. It should facilitate the assessment of whether or not a woman has an increased risk of such symptoms, and thus enable clinicians to adopt a more personalised approach to contraceptive counselling.

TI  - Increased Risk for Postpartum Psychiatric Disorders Among Women with Past Pregnancy Loss
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background: Scant literature exists on whether prior pregnancy loss (miscarriage, stillbirth, and/or induced abortion) increases the risk of postpartum psychiatric disordersspecifically depression and anxietyafter subsequent births. This study compares: (1) risk factors for depression and/or anxiety disorders in the postpartum year among women with and without prior pregnancy loss; and (2) rates of these disorders in women with one versus multiple pregnancy losses. Methods: One-hundred-ninety-two women recruited at first-year pediatric well-child care visits from an urban pediatric clinic provided demographic information, reproductive and health histories. They also completed depression screening tools and a standard semi-structured psychiatric diagnostic interview. Results: Almost half of the participants (49%) reported a previous pregnancy loss (miscarriage, stillbirth, or induced abortion). More than half of those with a history of pregnancy loss reported more than one loss (52%). Women with prior pregnancy loss were more likely to be diagnosed with major depression (p=0.002) than women without a history of loss. Women with multiple losses were more likely to be diagnosed with major depression (p=0.047) and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (Fisher's exact [FET]=0.028) than women with a history of one pregnancy loss. Loss type was not related to depression, although number of losses was related to the presence of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Low-income urban mothers have high rates of pregnancy loss and often have experienced more than one loss and/or more than one type of loss. Women with a history of pregnancy loss are at increased risk for depression and anxiety, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), after the birth of a child. Future research is needed to understand the reasons that previous pregnancy loss is associated with subsequent postpartum depression and anxiety among this population of women.

TI  - Psychiatric morbidity among patients with recurrent miscarriage
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - In this study 81 women with recurrent miscarriages completed questionnaires designed to assess depression, anxiety and general health. This data was matched with data from their medical notes to ascertain demographic and reproductive variables. The results indicated that 33 of patients could be classified as depressed with 9.9 of women being moderately depressed and 7.4 suffering from severe depression. Twenty-one percent of patients had levels of anxiety that were equal or higher to a typical psychiatric outpatient population. Neither age, cigarette consumption, alcohol intake, previous live birth, number of miscarriages, lateness of miscarriage nor length of time since last miscarriage were found to affect the degree of psychiatric morbidity. These findings add to our understanding of the degree to which recurrent miscarriage can affect mental health.

TI  - The association between the number of life births and certain frailty dimensions
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GERONTOLOGY AND GERIATRICS
AB  - Introduction: The association between pregnancy (in terms of number of life births, miscarriage/stillbirth and abortion) and frailty is poorly understood. Therefore, our aim was to fill this gap in knowledge. Methods: A subsample of n=488 women aged 65 or older from the nationally representative German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS1) was used. Physical frailty was defined as low grip strength, exhaustion (SF-36 item), low physical activity (absence of sports or exertion), slowness (Timed Up-andGo test > 15 seconds), and low body-mass-index (< 23 kg/m2). With regard to pregnancy: The number of live births, the lifetime presence of miscarriage/stillbirth, and the lifetime presence of an abortion were included in regressions. Results: Adjusting for various confounders, multiple logistic regressions revealed that having 3 or more live births in the life course (compared to no live birth) was associated with a reduced likelihood of slowness (OR: .23, 95% CI: .06-.99) and a lower likelihood of low grip strength (OR: .32, 95% CI: .11-.89), whereas the other pregnancyrelated factors were neither associated with the other frailty symptoms nor with the likelihood of overall frailty among older women. Conclusion: Some evidence was found for an association between a higher number of live births and a lower likelihood of slowness and low grip strength (as part of the frailty criteria) - which may indicate an active and healthy lifestyle among those women. However, the association between pregnancy and frailty remains poorly understood. More work is required in this research area.

TI  - The stigmatisation of abortion: a qualitative analysis of print media in Great Britain in 2010
T2  - CULTURE HEALTH & SEXUALITY
AB  - The media play a significant part in shaping public perceptions of health issues, and abortion attracts continued media interest. Detailed examination of media constructions of abortion may help to identify emerging public discourse. Qualitative content analysis was used to examine if and how the print media in contributes to the stigmatisation of abortion. Articles from seven British and five Scottish national newspapers from 2010 were analysed for overall framings of abortion and emergent themes, including potentially stigmatising discursive constructs and language. Abortion was found to be presented using predominantly negative language and discursive associations as risky', and in association with other discredited' social practices. Key perspectives were found to be absent or marginalised, including those of women who have sought abortion. Few articles framed abortion as a positive and legitimate choice. Negative media representations of abortion contribute to the stigmatisation of the procedure and of women who have it, and reflect a discrediting of women's reproductive decision-making. There is a need to challenge the notion that abortion stigma is inevitable, and to encourage positive framings of abortion in the media and other public discourse. Los medios de comunicacion son especialmente importantes a la hora de formar las percepciones publicas en cuestiones de salud, y el aborto atrae continuamente el interes de los medios. Un examen detallado de las construcciones mediaticas del aborto podria ayudar a identificar los nuevos discursos publicos. Mediante un analisis cualitativo de contenido, examinamos si los medios impresos contribuyen a estigmatizar el aborto, y de que forma. Se analizo la formulacion general del aborto y temas emergentes, incluyendo el posible estigma mediante las construcciones discursivas y el lenguaje, de articulos de siete periodicos nacionales britanicos y cinco escoceses de 2010. Se observo que el aborto se presento: mediante el uso de lenguaje y asociaciones discursivas predominantemente negativos, como arriesgado, y vinculado a otras practicas sociales desacreditadas. Se observo una falta o marginalizacion de perspectivas importantes, incluyendo las de las mujeres que querian abortar. En pocos articulos se presentaba el aborto como una opcion positiva y legitima. Las representaciones negativas del aborto que se observan en los medios de comunicacion contribuyen a estigmatizar esta practica y a las mujeres que la utilizan, y reflejan la deslegitimacion de las decisiones reproductivas de las mujeres. Es necesario cuestionar la nocion de que el estigma del aborto es inevitable, y estimular la formulacion positiva del aborto en los medios de comunicacion y otros discursos publicos. Les medias jouent un role essentiel dans la determination des perceptions du public sur les questions de sante, parmi lesquelles l'avortement qui suscite un interet constant de leur part. Un examen detaille des constructions mediatiques sur l'avortement peut aider a identifier le discours public qui en emane. L'analyse qualitative du contenu a ete employee pour examiner si et comment la presse ecrite contribue a la stigmatisation de l'avortement. Publies en 2010, les articles de sept journaux britanniques et de cinq journaux ecossais d'envergure nationale ont ete analyses pour determiner la formulation generale de l'avortement et des themes associes, y compris les constructions et le langage discursifs incitant potentiellement a la stigmatisation.
   Cette analyse a revele que l'avortement etait presente: dans un langage negatif predominant, accompagne d'associations discursives; comme << dangereux >>; et comme associe a d'autres pratiques sociales << discreditees >>. L'absence et la marginalisation des perspectives cle ont elles aussi ete revelees, notamment les points de vue des femmes ayant souhaite interrompre leurs grossesses. Peu d'articles avaient presente l'avortement comme un choix positif et legitime. Les representations negatives des medias sur l'avortement contribuent a la stigmatisation de cette pratique et des femmes qui y ont recours. Elles sont le reflet du discredit que subissent les prises de decision des femmes en matiere de reproduction. La notion selon laquelle le stigma de l'avortement est inevitable doit etre remise en question. De meme, la formulation de l'avortement dans les medias et dans les autres discours publics, sous un angle plus positif, doit etre encouragee.

TI  - Reproductive coercion and abuse in Australia: what do we need to know?
T2  - SEXUAL HEALTH
AB  - Reproductive coercion and abuse refers to patterns of controlling and manipulative behaviours used to interfere with a person's reproductive health and decision-making. Unintended pregnancy, forced abortion or continuation of a pregnancy, and sexually transmissible infections all may result from reproductive coercion, which is closely associated with intimate partner and sexual violence. Clinicians providing sexual and reproductive healthcare are in a key position to identify and support those affected. Yet, reproductive coercion and abuse is not currently screened for in most settings and addressing disclosures poses many challenges. This article discusses what reproductive coercion and abuse is, who it affects, how it impacts, and potential strategies to improve identification and response.

T2  - WESTERN JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH
AB  - The traumatic aspects of positive diagnosis of a severe fetal anomaly have garnered the most attention, but the personal growth in the aftermath of this event remains relatively unexplored. We used the five dimensions of growth and change from Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) to analyze data generated from ethnographic interviews conducted with 15 women and 10 of their male partners in the aftermath of a severe fetal diagnosis. Eighteen (12 women and 6 men) of these 25 participants experienced positive change across these dimensions. Relating to others was the dimension that showed the most consistent early and prolonged change. Six of the 10 couples had congruent profiles of change. Negative change was evident in 2 women and 2 men. Recognizing the potential for growth allows nurses opportunities to promote it in the aftermath of severe fetal diagnosis.

TI  - The American Psychological Association's Committee on Women in Psychology: 40 Years of Contributions to the Transformation of Psychology
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY
AB  - The Committee on Women in Psychology (CWP) of the American Psychological Association was founded in 1973 in response to the report of the Task Force on the Status of Women in Psychology. In this article, we set the context for the founding of the task force and committee and briefly describe the history of feminist critique of, and activism within, organized psychology in the United States. From its inception to the present day, CWP has been known as an activist group. We review some of the major contributions CWP has made over four decades in service of the feminist transformation of psychology. We also review the committee's major contributions to psychology in the public interest, especially to the physical and mental health and well-being of women.

TI  - Pregnancy acceptance, parenting stress, and toddler attachment in low-income black families
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY
AB  - Questionnaire items tapping feelings about pregnancy were administered to 173 young, low-income primiparous Black mothers who either were pregnant or had delivered within the past year. A factor analysis indicated that 11 items together measured mothers' acceptance of the pregnancies that resulted in the births of their first children. Links to mothers' later parenting stress, warmth, and their toddlers' attachment security were explored. Pregnancy acceptance was a negative predictor of one aspect of maternal parenting stress (distress resulting from feelings that parenting is burdensome) and a positive predictor of toddler attachment security. It did not, however, predict another aspect of parenting stress (feelings that interactions with children are not enjoyable) or maternal warmth.

TI  - Gendered denials: Vulnerability created by barriers to legal capacity for women and disabled women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY
AB  - This article explores the vulnerability that is created when legal capacity is denied to women and disabled women. It argues that vulnerability is largely contingent on social constructs - as opposed to being an inherent quality of disability or gender. It discusses barriers to the exercise of legal capacity that women and disabled women experience - such as limitations on reproductive choice, higher rates of substituted decision-making, and unique experiences with forced mental health treatment. It then explores evidence that such barriers are dis-empowering and can leave women and disabled women vulnerable to abuse and marginalisation. It explores financial, physical and sexual abuse that can occur as a result of this vulnerability. Finally, it concludes that autonomy and power are inextricably linked and can be essential for minimising vulnerability.

TI  - The contribution of negative reproductive experiences and chronic medical conditions to depression and pain among Israeli women
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH & MEDICINE
AB  - This study of 302 Israeli women sought to investigate the associations among stressful reproductive experiences (e.g. fertility problems, abortions, and traumatic births), chronic medical conditions, pain, and depression. The specific aims of the study were to examine (1) the effect of stressful reproductive experiences, chronic medical conditions, and pain on depressive symptoms and (2) the effect of stressful reproductive experiences, chronic medical conditions, and depressive symptoms on pain. Our findings corroborate with previous studies demonstrating that depression and pain are two interrelated, but different phenomena, which have both common and distinct risk factors. The findings are discussed in the light of stress and adaptation theories that point to the long-term effects of stressful life events on emotional and physiological aspects such as depression and pain.

TI  - Progesterone-mediated reversal of mifepristone-induced pregnancy termination in a rat model: an exploratory investigation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Globally, a substantial proportion of pregnancies end in induced (particularly medication) abortion. However, data also indicates a percentage of women who seek assistance in potentially reversing the medication abortion process. While previous literature has suggested the potential for progesterone-mediated reversal of mifepristone-induced abortion, this process has not been effectively investigated pre-clinically. Our study explored the potential reversal of mifepristone-induced pregnancy termination using progesterone in a rat model, following a clear initiation of pregnancy termination. Female Long-Evans rats were divided into three groups (n = 10-16/group): Pregnant control (M-P-), mifepristone-only/pregnancy termination (M+P-) and mifepristone + progesterone (M+P+). Drug/vehicle administration occurred on day 12 of gestation (first-trimester human equivalent). Rat weight was measured throughout gestation. Uterine blood, collected post-drug/vehicle administration, was analyzed spectrophotometrically to measure blood loss. Additionally, at the end of gestation (day 21), ultrasound was utilized to confirm pregnancy and measure fetal heart rate. Number of gestational sacs, uterine weights and diameters were obtained following tissue collection. Our results indicate that progesterone administration following initiation of mifepristone-induced pregnancy termination (indicated by weight loss and uterine bleeding) reversed the process in 81% of rats in the M+P+ group. Following the initial weight loss, these rats proceeded to gain weight at a similar rate to the M-P- group, in contrast to the continued decrease displayed by the M+P- group (and unsuccessful reversals). Moreover, while uterine blood loss was similar to that of the M+P- group (confirming pregnancy termination initiation), number of gestational sacs, uterine weights, diameters, approximate fetal weights and fetal heart rates were similar to the M-P- group. Thus, our results indicate a clear progesterone-mediated reversal of an initiated mifepristone-induced pregnancy termination in a rat model at first-trimester human equivalent, with resultant fully developed living fetuses at the end of gestation, clearly indicating the necessity for further pre-clinical investigation to assist in better informing the scientific/medical communities of the potential implications in humans.

TI  - Impact of Covid-19 in pregnancy on mother's psychological status and infant's neurobehavioral development: a longitudinal cohort study in China
T2  - BMC MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundEvidence concerning the long-term impact of Covid-19 in pregnancy on mother's psychological disorder and infant's developmental delay is unknown.MethodsThis study is a longitudinal single-arm cohort study conducted in China between May 1 and July 31, 2020. Seventy-two pregnant patients with Covid-19 participated in follow-up surveys until 3 months after giving birth (57 cases) or having abortion (15 cases). We collected data from medical records regarding Covid-19, delivery or abortion, testing results of maternal and neonatal specimens, and questionnaires of quarantine, mother-baby separation, feeding, and measuring of mothers' mental disorders and infants' neurobehavioral disorders.ResultsAll cases infected in the first trimester and 1/3 of cases infected in the second trimester had an abortion to terminate the pregnancy. 22.2% of pregnant patients were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression at 3 months after delivery or induced abortion. Among 57 live births, only one neonate was positive of nucleic acid testing for throat swab, but negative in repeated tests subsequently. The median duration of mother-baby separation was 35days (interquartile range 16 to 52days). After the termination of maternal quarantine, 49.1% of mothers chose to prolong the mother-baby separation (median 8days; IQR 5 to 23days). The breastfeeding rate was 8.8% at 1 week after birth, 19.3% at the age of 1 month, and 36.8% at the age of 3 months, respectively. The proportion of "monitoring" and "risk" in the social-emotional developmental domain at the age of 3 months was 22.7% and 63.6%, respectively. After the adjustment of preterm, neonatal sex, admitted to NICU, and the mother's Covid-19 condition, the negative associations were significantly identified (p<0.05) between mother-baby separation days and three developmental domains: communication, gross motor, and personal-social.ConclusionsThere is no definite evidence on vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to control infection risk, researchers and healthcare providers should pay more attention to maternal mental health and infant's feeding, closeness with parents, and early development.

TI  - Urgent need for contraceptive education and services in Chinese unmarried undergraduates: A multi-campus survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - In order to ascertain prevalence rate of premarital sexual intercourse, unintended pregnancy and abortion, and evaluate associated factors of unintended pregnancy among undergraduates from all over China, the representative sample of unmarried undergraduates was obtained by using a multi-stage, stratified, probability cluster design, and data were collected by using a survey questionnaire. 62 326 available responders were gained. 11.6% of them acknowledged having experiences of premarital sexual intercourse (standardized prevalence rate of sexual intercourse was 13.8%). 31.5% of students active in premarital sex acknowledged undergoing unintended pregnancy. 76.2% of pregnant students selected abortion to end it. Of students active in premarital sex, 46.2% used contraception at the first sexual intercourse, 28.2% replied "always" using contraception in sexual intercourse. The rate of using condoms, oral contraceptives (OCs), and withdrawal among students who had used contraception was 52.0%, 31.0%, and 27.2% respectively. "No preparation for sex" (40.3%), "pleasure decrement" (32.1%), "won't-be-pregnancy in occasional sexual intercourse" (30.2%) were their common excuses for using no contraception. The identified risk factors for unintended pregnancy among students active in premarital sex by multivariate analysis were as follows: having no steady lover [having no steady lover vs having a steady lover: odds ratio (OR), 1.875; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.629-2.158], unaware of the course of conception (unaware vs aware: OR, 2.023; 95% CI, 1.811-2.260), considering abortion not endanger women's physical and mental health (no endangerment vs endangerment: OR, 2.659; 95% CI, 2.265-3.121), nonuse of contraception (never use vs always use: OR, 1.682; 95% CI, 1.295-2.185). Medical students were not less likely to experience an unintended pregnancy than nonmedical students (OR, 1.111; 95% CI, 0.906-1.287). The substantial proportion of unintended pregnancy among undergraduates indicates a need for convenient and targeted contraceptive education and services.

TI  - Valuing Life as Necessary for Moral Status
T2  - NEUROETHICS
AB  - Many contemporary accounts of moral status consider an individual's status to be grounded in some cognitive capacity, e.g. the capacity to experience certain states, to reason morally, etc. One proposed cognitive capacity significant particularly to killing, i.e. having a status that precludes being killed absent cause, is the capacity to value one's own life. I argue that considering this a condition for moral status is a mistake, as it would lead to the exclusion of some individuals with mental health problems who are generally considered clear cases. While a cognitive capacities approach may turn out to be generally feasible, that particular cognitive capacity is not. In the course of this discussion I address two conceptual issues, the first regarding what it means to 'value one's life' and the second regarding what conditions must obtain for something to count as a capacity. These conceptual issues, when resolved pursuant to this account of moral status, lead the account to exclude individuals with major depressive disorder, i.e. deny that it is morally wrong to kill such individuals based on their moral status. I then argue that this is decisive reason to reject this particular cognitive capacity as implicated in moral status.

TI  - Ethical issues relating to reproduction control and women's health
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
AB  - There are many ethical aspects which derive from the application of reproduction control in women's health. Women's health can be enhanced if women are given the opportunity to make their own reproduction choices about sex, contraception, abortion and application of reproductive technologies. The main issues that raise ethical dilemmas following the development of assisted reproduction techniques are: the right to procreate or reproduce; the process of in vitro fertilization itself - is it morally acceptable to interfere in the reproduction process?; the moral status of the embryo; the involvement of a third party in the reproductive process by genetic material donation; the practice of surrogacy; cryopreservation of pre-embryos; genetic manipulation; experiments on pre-embryos, etc. Induced abortion raises ethical issues related to the rights of the woman versus the rights of the fetus. For those who consider life to begin at conception abortion always equals murder and is therefore forbidden. Those who believe in the absolute autonomy of the woman over her body take the other extreme approach. The discussion surrounding abortion usually centers on whether it should be legal or illegal. Access to safe abortion is critical to the health of women and to their autonomy. The development of new effective contraceptive methods has a profound impact on women's lives. By the use of contraception it is possible to lessen maternal, infant and child mortality and to reduce the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases. Research and development of new effective reversible contraceptives for women and men is needed. Dissemination of information about the safety and effectiveness of contraceptive methods is of great importance. Female genital mutilation is still practiced worldwide due to customs and tradition among various ethnic groups. The procedure is considered to be medically detrimental to the physical and mental health of women and girls, and is considered by many as oppression of women. The practice has to be stopped. Recognition of the fetus as a 'patient' has a potential effect on women's right for autonomy; they have no legal obligation to undergo invasive procedures and to risk their health for the sake of their fetuses. The woman carries ethical obligations toward her fetus. This obligation should not be enforced by the law. At present women bear most of the burden of reproductive health. All of them have a right of access to fertility regulation. Governments and society must ensure the women's equal rights to health care just as men have in the regulation of their fertility.

TI  - Contraception, reproductive health and pregnancy outcomes among women exposed to intimate partner violence in Nigeria
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTRACEPTION AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE
AB  - Objectives To examine the association between reproductive health practices/outcomes and exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) among women in Nigeria. More specifically, the association between IPV and use of contraception; miscarriages, induced abortions, stillbirths, and infant mortality; and having many children, was assessed.
   Methods Data on studied variables were retrieved from the Demographic and Health Surveys of Nigeria 2008, a nationally representative sample of 33,385 women of reproductive age. IPV was defined as exposure to physical, sexual or emotional abuse. The association between contraception use, pregnancy outcomes and infant mortality, and exposure to IPV was assessed using the chi-square test for unadjusted analyses. To control for potential confounding, socio-demographic variables were adjusted for using multiple logistic regression.
   Results Compared with women not exposed to IPV, those who were, exhibited a higher likelihood of using modern forms of contraception; having a history of miscarriages, induced abortions, stillbirths, or infant mortality; and having many children. The aforementioned observations still stood after adjustment for potential confounders (e.g., demographic and socioeconomic factors).
   Conclusion Though causal inference cannot be drawn due to the cross-sectional design, the study has important implications for incorporation of IPV detection and management in initiatives aimed at improving women's reproductive health.

TI  - Associations between hormonal contraception use, sociodemographic factors and mental health: a nationwide, register-based, matched case-control study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives Sociodemographic and mental health characteristics are associated with contraceptive choices. We aimed to describe the sociodemographic, reproductive and mental health characteristics of all fertile-aged women in Finland who used hormonal contraception (HC) in 2017. Design A nationwide, register-based study. Setting All women living in Finland in 2017; data from the Care Register of Health Care, Medical Birth Register, Population Register Centre, Prescription Centre, Register of Induced Abortions. Participants All women aged 15-49 with one redeemed HC prescription in 2017 (n=294 356), and a same-sized, age-matched and residence-matched, control group of non-users. Outcomes Rates of HC use; associations between HC use and mental disorders, sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics. Results 25.8% of women aged 15-49 years used HC. Women with the lowest socioeconomic levels had lower odds of using HC than women with upper-level statuses (OR, 95% CI students: 0.97, 0.94 to 0.99; entitled to pension: 0.66, 0.63 to 0.69; other: 0.87, 0.85 to 0.89; unknown: 0.90, 0.85 to 0.90). Women with the highest education (secondary: 1.46, 1.43 to 1.48; tertiary: 1.64, 1.58 to 1.70; academic: 1.60, 1.56 to 1.63) and income (second quarter: 1.57, 1.54 to 1.60; third quarter: 1.85, 1.82 to 1.89; fourth quarter: 2.01, 1.97 to 2.06), and unmarried women had higher odds of using HC than women with the lowest education and income levels, and married (0.61, 0.60 to 0.62), divorced (0.86, 0.84 to 0.88), widowed (0.73, 0.65 to 0.83) or other marital status women (0.26, 0.22 to 0.30). Parous women (0.70, 0.69 to 0.71), those with previous induced abortion(s) (0.91, 0.89 to 0.92) or recent eating (0.68, 0.62 to 0.75) or personality (0.89, 0.79 to 0.97) disorders had lower odds of HC use. Absolute risk differences between women with and without mental disorders ranged from 3.1% (anxiety disorders) to 10.1% (eating disorders). Conclusions A quarter of the fertile-aged women use HC in Finland. Sociodemographic disparities persist in relation to HC use, although of small effect size. HC use is less common among women suffering from severe to moderate psychiatric disorders, especially eating disorders.

TI  - Perinatal and background risk factors for childhood autism in central China
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
AB  - Perinatal and background risk factors for autism were identified in a cohort of autistic children in Zhengzhou, China, to formulate preventative and treatment strategies for high-risk families. In this case-control study, children were screened for suspected autism using the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) and diagnosed according to DSM-IV and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). We collected perinatal histories and clinical data of 286 confirmed autistic children treated at the Third Affiliated Hospital Children's Psychological Clinic of Zhengzhou University from 2011 to 2013. The control group consisted of 286 healthy children from area kindergartens. Maternal age > 30 years, parental introversion as measured by the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, low level of parental education, smoking, abortion threat, pregnancy complications, maternal illness during pregnancy, maternal mental health, family history of mental illness, neonatal jaundice, birth asphyxia, premature rupture of the fetal membrane, and gestational age < 37 weeks were significantly higher in the autism group. These factors were significantly correlated with behavioral symptoms as measured by ABC scores (Kendall rank correlation). Birth asphyxia, neonatal jaundice, maternal age, parental introversion, family history of mental illness, abortion threat, premature delivery, and smoking were identified as independent risk factors by multivariate logistic regression.

TI  - Epidemiology of Common Mental Disorders among women in the rural zones of Rio Grande, RS, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA
AB  - The scope of this study is to describe the prevalence and the factors associated with common mental disorders in women aged 18 to 49, residents in the rural zone of the municipality of Rio Grande-RS. A cross-sectional study was carried out with data collection conducted in 2017. A systematic sampling process of the residences of the rural area of the municipality was utilized. The General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) was used to track common mental disorders. Crude and adjusted Poisson regression was used to estimate the prevalence ratios (PR) and respective 95% confidence intervals. The overall prevalence of Common Mental Disorders was 36.4%, being more common among women with lower levels of education, who had had an abortion and were smokers. In quantifying the occurrence and factors associated with common mental disorders in a population of women in a rural area, this study provides an original scientific contribution on the burden of this important outcome in a population that has not been studied in epidemiological surveys. The results can contribute to the health services by identifying the women most susceptible to this outcome, thus, improving the adequacy of the services offered to the health needs of rural residents.

TI  - HIV-Related Risk Among Female Migrants Working in Entertainment Venues in China
T2  - PREVENTION SCIENCE
AB  - China has experienced a surge in internal migration during the past decade, and migrant populations have been identified as a high-risk group for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Young female migrants often find employment in entertainment venues (bars, karaoke parlors, and massage parlors) located in metropolitan cities, and sex work transactions frequently occur in these venues. We examined factors associated with risk for HIV, other STIs, and reproductive health challenges in a cross-sectional study of 358 young female migrants, ages 18-29, working in entertainment venues in a rapidly growing urban city in China. Results indicate high levels of behavioral risk for HIV and other STIs, low rates of HIV testing, and high prevalence of problem drinking and mental health problems, including recent depression symptoms and suicidal ideation. Factors associated with increased STIs and genitourinary tract infections included commercial sex work, early sexual debut, abortion history, illicit drug use, and anxiety. Factors associated with increased HIV testing included employment in an affluent entertainment venue, education level, knowledge about where to obtain free HIV tests, condom use, and general HIV/AIDS knowledge. Findings of this study highlight the insufficient coverage of current public health services to female migrants working in entertainment venues and call for more assertive prevention interventions to mitigate risk for sexual, reproductive, behavioral, and mental health problems in this mobile population.

TI  - Inhibition of HMGB1 Ameliorates the Maternal-Fetal Interface Destruction in Unexplained Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion by Suppressing Pyroptosis Activation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is a common complication of pregnancy that affects the physical and mental health of pregnant women, and approximately 50% of the mechanisms are unclear. Our previous studies have found that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) molecules are highly expressed at the maternal-fetal interface of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) patients. The purpose of this study was to further detect the expression of HMGB1 and pyroptosis in decidual tissue of URSA patients, and explore the potential mechanism of the protective role of HMGB1 in URSA patients and mouse model. The decidua tissues of 75 URSA patients and 75 women who actively terminated pregnancy were collected, and URSA mouse models were established and treated with HMGB1 inhibitor-aspirin. The expression of HMGB1, and their receptors (RAGE, TLR2, TLR4), pyroptosis-associated proteins (NLRP-3, caspase-1, GSDMD) and NF-kappa B was examined at the maternal-fetal interface of human and mouse. Our study found that HMGB1, NLRP-3, Caspase-1, GSDMD, RAGE, TLR2 and TLR4 were highly expressed and NF-kappa B signaling pathway were activated in the decidua tissue of URSA group. Moreover, immune cell disorder and co-localization of HMGB1 and macrophages were found at the maternal-fetal interface of URSA mice. However, HMGB1, TLR2, TLR4, NF-kappa B, and pyroptosis-associated proteins can be down-regulated by administering low-dose aspirin. These data may indicate that highly expressed HMGB1 was actively secreted by macrophages and then activated pyroptosis through the TLR2/TLR4-NF-kappa B pathway to cause aseptic inflammation, leading to the occurrence and development of URSA. Moreover, low-dose aspirin can reduce HMGB1 protein levels of serum and decidual in URSA.

TI  - FPR2 serves a role in recurrent spontaneous abortion by regulating trophoblast function via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
T2  - MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS
AB  - Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) effects both the physical and mental health of women of reproductive age. Trophoblast dysfunction may result in RSA due to shallow placental implantation. The mechanisms underlying formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) on the biological functions of trophoblasts remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to explore the potential functions of FPR2, a G protein-coupled receptor, in placental trophoblasts. The location and expression levels of FPR2 in the villi tissue of patients with RSA were detected using immunohistochemical staining, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. Following the transfection of small interfering RNA targeting FPR2 in HTR-8/SVneo cells, a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to determine the levels of cell viability. Flow cytometry was used to examine the levels of cell apoptosis and gap closure and Transwell assays were carried out to evaluate the levels of cell migration and invasion. A tube formation assay was performed to detect the levels of capillary-like structure formation. Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of proteins in the associated signaling pathways. The expression of FPR2 was present in villi trophoblasts and was markedly increased in patients with RSA. The levels of trophoblast invasion, migration and tube formation were markedly increased following FPR2 knockdown, whereas the levels of apoptosis were markedly decreased. In addition, FPR2 knockdown caused an increase in the phosphorylation levels of AKT and PI3K. Thus, FPR2 may be involved in the regulation of trophoblast function via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The results of the present study provided a theoretical basis for the use of FPR2 as a target for the treatment of trophoblast-associated diseases, such as RSA.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors of perinatal depression among women in rural Bihar: A community-based cross-sectional study
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: Perinatal depression (PND) is one of the most common mental disorders occurring during the perinatal period among women. Few studies examined prevalence and risk factors of PND from rural settings in India. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of perinatal depression and identify social risk factors for it among women from rural Bihar.
   Materials and methods: A cross sectional study was conducted in a community setting in rural areas of Bihar. All perinatal women were screened through a door to door survey and recruited after obtaining informed consent. A semi-structured proforma was used to collect sociodemographic characteristics and family related variables. Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) was used to screen for perinatal depression.
   Results: A total of 564 perinatal women were recruited into the study. The estimated prevalence of PND was 23.9 % (95 % CI: 20.6,27.6). Multivariate analysis showed perinatal depression was associated with physical illness in the mother, previous history of abortion, poor financial status and ill-treatment by in-laws.
   Conclusion: Prevalence of perinatal depression among women is high in rural settings of North India. A multitude of factors ranging from physical, obstetric, economic and family related confer a high risk for PND. Comprehensive interventions are needed to address these risk factors of perinatal depression.

TI  - The health profile of newly-arrived refugee women and girls and the role of region of origin: using a population-based dataset in California between 2013 and 2017
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Background There has been an increasing number of refugee women globally; yet, there is little recent data describing the health profile of refugee women by region of origin in the United States. It is important to monitor the health status of women by region of origin to provide needed targeted interventions. Methods We analyzed the Refugee Health Electronic Information System (RHEIS), a population-based dataset that included 14,060 female refugees who entered California between October 3, 2013 and February 15, 2017. We assessed differences in health status by region of origin. Results Almost one out of three women experienced a traumatic event. Women from Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean experienced higher levels of trauma compared to other regions, including sexual assault, physical, and weapon assault. More than half of women and girls (56.6%) reported experiences of persecution, with Southeast Asians reporting the highest levels. Among women of reproductive age, 7.0% of women were currently pregnant at the time of arrival to the US, 19.0% ever had a spontaneous abortion, and 8.6% reported ever having an abortion. One in three women from Africa reported female genital cutting. Moreover, 80.0% of women reported needing language assistance at the time of their health assessment. Conclusions Refugee women and girls experience high levels of trauma and persecution, suggesting the need for trauma-informed care. Those working with refugee women, such as resettlement agencies and health providers, should be equipped with information about antenatal care, nutrition, and pregnancy to newly arrived women. Lastly, differences in health status by region of origin indicate a need for tailored interventions and linguistically appropriate health information.

TI  - How does stigma influence depressive symptoms among women who underwent termination of pregnancy for foetal anomaly: A path analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
AB  - Aim and Objectives The purpose of this study was to explore the effect and paths of stigma on depressive symptoms in women who underwent termination of pregnancy for foetal anomaly (TOPFA). Background Stigma may cause distress and depressive symptoms for women with TOPFA. However, few studies have examined the relationship between stigma and depression in women with TOPFA. Design This study followed the STROBE checklist. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 469 women with TOPFA. The path analysis used hierarchical multiple regression and structural equation model to examine the mediating role of social support and psychological flexibility on the relationship between stigma and depressive symptoms. Results Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed the mediation effect of psychological flexibility between stigma and depressive symptoms. By contrast, social support did not present such effect. The structural equation model confirmed that stigma, directly and indirectly, affected depressive symptoms. Discussion Many women with TOPFA have severe depressive symptoms and that stigma is an important influencing factor. Psychological flexibility plays an essential role in mitigating the effects of stigma on depressive symptoms. Relevance to clinical practice Healthcare professionals should focus on measuring and intervening on stigma and psychological flexibility for alleviating the depressive symptoms of women with TOPFA. No Patient or Public Contribution.

TI  - Women's experiences of miscarriage related to diagnosis, duration, and type of treatment
T2  - ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Introduction Women with miscarriage experience several negative emotional feelings such as grief, isolation, coping, and despair. However, less is known about how the type of treatment and diagnosis of miscarriage influence the emotional experience. Material and methods Results The present study was a randomized prospective longitudinal cohort study, in which women with spontaneous miscarriage (n = 35), and women with missed miscarriage (n = 67), were included to answer three validated questionnaires: Revised Impact of Miscarriage Scale, Perinatal Grief Scale, and Montgomery and angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale, concerning experience of miscarriage, psychological well-being, and mental health 1 week and 4 months after finalized treatment. There was no difference between the 2 diagnosis groups in feelings as measured by Revised Impact of Miscarriage Scale, Montgomery and angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale, and Perinatal Grief Scale 1 week after the miscarriage. However, the psychological well-being improved significantly 4 months after the miscarriage. Separated by treatment, women treated with misoprostol alone had more depressive symptoms than women treated with misoprostol and subsequent vacuum aspiration. Conclusions It can be concluded that diagnosis of miscarriage had limited influence on the experiences of miscarriage, but shorter duration of treatment with misoprostol and subsequent vacuum aspiration resulted in fewer depressive symptoms.

TI  - Identifying variables in relation to health-related quality of life among married women of reproductive age in Sivas Turkey
T2  - WOMEN & HEALTH
AB  - A cross-sectional study was performed to identify the factors associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among 1,236 married Turkish women aged 15-49 years, in the urban area of Sivas, between January and July 2017. Multiple logistic regression analyzes showed that being unemployed [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18-2.25], and having an unsatisfying sexual life (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.17-2.03), a chronic illness (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.27-2.17), more than three children (AOR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.03-1.86), and experienced domestic violence (AOR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.55-2.98) were associated with worse mental HRQoL. Having less than a high school education (AOR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.33-3.02), a chronic illness (AOR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.88-3.30), a history of abortion (AOR = 1.59, CI = 1.09-2.31), and experienced domestic violence (AOR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.21-2.40) were associated with worse physical HRQoL. These findings suggest that health care providers or policy makers should pay special attention to unemployed women who are less educated, have more than three children and those having unsatisfied sexual lives, chronic illness, domestic violence experience and abortion history to enhance their HRQoL.

TI  - A quantitative assessment of termination of sexual violence-related pregnancies in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - CONFLICT AND HEALTH
AB  - Background: Sexual violence is prevalent in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and has resulted in sexual violence-related pregnancies (SVRPs). Despite restrictive laws, women may seek to terminate SVRPs; however, there are limited data on termination of SVRPs.
   Methods: A mixed methods study was conducted in 2012 in Bukavu, DRC. Adult women who self-reported an SVRP and termination of that SVRP were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Trained female interviewers verbally administered a quantitative survey to all participants and a semi-structured qualitative survey to a subset. Quantitative data on characteristics and complications of pregnancy termination, including mental health outcomes, were analyzed using SAS.
   Results: In total, 86 women completed quantitative surveys. Most SVRPs (93 %) involved two or more assailants; 73 % occurred while in captivity. Most women (82 %) terminated the SVRPs at 3 months gestation or earlier; 79 % reported one attempt at pregnancy termination and 21 % more than one attempt. The most common methods of termination were an oral medicine (55 %) or herb (35 %); cimpokolo (31 %) and quinine (18 %) were most frequently reported. These methods were accessed through friends (37 %), healthcare providers (18 %), family (16 %), or self-obtained (12 %). Following the termination, 79 % of women reported subsequent physical symptoms, including abdominal pain (74 %), bleeding (47 %), vaginal discharge (35 %) and fever (18 %); 44 % sought medical care for their symptoms. Varied emotional responses to the termination were reported and included relief (34 %), anxiety (21 %), anger (19 %), guilt (19 %), and regret (10 %). At the time of the study, many women met symptom criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (57 %), depression (50 %), and generalized anxiety disorder (33 %).
   Conclusion: Most women terminated SVRPs using medications or herbs not recognized as evidence-based methods of pregnancy termination and sought these methods outside of the formal healthcare sector. These data suggest that access to safe abortion methods is needed for women with SVRPs in DRC. Physical symptoms and emotional reactions related to the termination varied. While it is not possible to differentiate the impacts of sexual violence, SVRP, and pregnancy termination on mental health outcomes, the findings highlight the complex needs of women with SVRPs and opportunities for integrative health services.

TI  - Is there a place for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in the treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss?
T2  - JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) impacts a couple's quality of life, mental health and constitutes a large economic burden for care. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an integrated systematic medical practice with wide clinical applications that has been predominantly used throughout Asian countries for over 2000 years. However, the efficacy of TCM in the treatment of RPL remains unclear due not only to a lack of experimental evidence, but also a lack of comprehensive summarized conclusions. Therefore, the current manuscript reviews recent relevant publications of the clinical use of TCM in RPL and illustrates its potential mechanisms. All publications (in both Chinese and English), especially randomized controlled trials (RCTs), on the use of TCM in RPL for the last ten years and research on its mechanisms were included. This review also describes our understanding of the problems and challenges in the modernization of TCM research.

TI  - Prevalence and Factors Associated With Depressive Symptomatology Among Women Before Termination of Pregnancy for Fetal Anomaly
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOCIAL NURSING AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES
AB  - The purpose of the current study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptomatology before termination of pregnancy due to fetal anomaly and to analyze associated risk factors. A cross-sectional study was performed in the obstetric departments of six hospitals in Hunan, China. Depressive symptomatology was measured before termination of pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale. t test, analysis of variance, and binary logistic regression tests were used in the data analysis of depressive symptomatology and factors. A total of 65.6% (n = 177) of participants were identified with depressive symptomatology before termination. Risk factors were receipt of spousal support, self-efficacy, religious belief, history of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and sleep disturbance. Protective factors were engagement with health care providers, social support, and higher monthly family income. Nurses should be aware of these factors early on to prevent the occurrence of depressive symptomatology, thereby improving maternal mental health.

TI  - Longitudinal study of emotional experiences, grief and depressive symptoms in women and men after miscarriage
T2  - MIDWIFERY
AB  - Objective: Although miscarriage is common and affects up to 20% of pregnant women, little is known about these couples' short term and long term experiences after miscarriage. The aim of the present study was to study emotional experience, grief and depressive symptoms in women and men, one week and four months after miscarriage.
   Research design / setting: Women, (n = 103), and their male partner (n = 78), were recruited at the gynecological clinic after miscarriage. Control women were recruited from the general population. Three validated questionnaires concerning psychological wellbeing and mental health, RIMS, PGS and MADRS-S were answered by the participants one week and four months after the miscarriage.
   Findings: It was shown that for women, the emotional experiences of miscarriage, grief and depressive symptoms were more pronounced than for their male partners. Grief and depressive symptoms were reduced with time, which was not the case for the emotional experiences of miscarriage. Previous children was favorable for emotional experience while previous miscarriage or infertility treatment made the emotional experience worse.
   Conclusion: Grief and depressive symptoms is reduced over time while emotional experiences such as isolation, loss of baby and a devastating event persist for longer time than four months. Lack of previous children, previous miscarriage and infertility diagnosis could increase negative emotional experiences after miscarriage, this was especially pronounced for grief reaction. The questionnaires could be used both clinically and in research to understand the emotional experiences after miscarriage.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
CP  - 58th Annual Meeting of the South-Atlantic-Association-of-Obstetricians-and-Gynecologists
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We attempted to determine the national rape-related pregnancy rate and provide descriptive characteristics of pregnancies that result from rape.
   STUDY DESIGN: A national probability sample of 4008 adult American women look part in a 3-year longitudinal survey that assessed the prevalence and incidence of rape and related physical and mental health outcomes.
   RESULTS: The national rape-related pregnancy rate is 5.0% per rape among victims of reproductive age (aged 12 to 45); among adult women an estimated 32,101 pregnancies result from rape each year. Among 34 cases of rape-related pregnancy, the majority occurred among adolescents and resulted from assault by a known, often related perpetrator. Only 11.7% of these victims received immediate medical attention after the assault, and 47.1% received no medical attention related to the rape. A total 32.4% of these Victims did not discover they were pregnant until they had already entered the second trimester; 32.2% opted to keep the infant whereas 50% underwent abortion and 5.9% placed the infant for adoption; an additional 11.8% had spontaneous abortion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Rape-related pregnancy occurs with significant frequency. It is a cause of many unwanted pregnancies and is closely linked with family and domestic violence. As we address the epidemic of unintended pregnancies in the United States, greater attention and effort should be aimed al preventing and identifying unwanted pregnancies that result from sexual victimization.

TI  - Stigma in the context of pregnancy termination after diagnosis of fetal anomaly: associations with grief, trauma, and depression
T2  - ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Termination of pregnancy after diagnosis of fetal anomaly (TOPFA) is a contested issue and stigma may negatively impact affected women's psychological reactions. This study examined the influence of perceived and internalized stigma on women's long-term adjustment to a TOPFA. One hundred forty-eight women whose TOPFA dated back 1 to 7 years responded to self-report questionnaires. The associations between perceived stigma at the time of the TOPFA, current internalized stigma and symptoms of grief, trauma and depression were modeled using multiple linear regression. The proportion of participants reporting scores above the cutoffs on the respective scale was 17.6% for grief, 18.9% for posttraumatic stress, and 10.8% for depression. After controlling for time since the TOPFA, pre-TOPFA mental health and obstetric variables, higher levels of current internalized stigma were related to higher levels of grief, trauma, and depression. Mediation analyses suggested that the effect of perceived stigma at the time of the TOPFA on symptoms of grief and trauma was mediated by current internalized stigma, but the cross-sectional design limited causal interpretation of results. Internalized stigma is associated with long-term psychological distress following a TOPFA. Perceived stigma at the time of the TOPFA may contribute to increased trauma and grief symptomatology, but results need to be validated in longitudinal studies. Health care providers and public initiatives should aim at reducing stigma among affected women.

TI  - Psychological factors affecting health after toxicological disasters
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
AB  - Exposure to toxic substances in the environment is an ever more common event, that may cause physical as well as psychological harm. When an entire community is exposed, the term 'toxicological diaster' is used. The mere threat of such an event may be a source of stress, associated with changes in mental health, physical health, and changes in health-related behaviors. A review is presented of the literature about the effects of the stressful experience of toxicological disasters on health and health-related behaviors. Three questions are examined: (a) do toxicological disasters represent a specific type of stressor, different from other stressors?; (b) which stress-mediated health effects have been observed in the aftermath of toxicological disasters? and (c) is there evidence for a higher vulnerability in certain identifiable risk groups? On the basis of the available literature, it is concluded hat toxicological disasters may have profound effects on subjective health, especially on symptom reporting, and on a number of psychophysiological parameters. Evidence for a substantial impact of disaster-related stress on either physical or psychiatric morbidity remains inconclusive. In this respect toxicological disasters do not appear to differ from other stressors. There is some evidence that toxicological disasters may have a more pronounced effect on health related behaviors, especially on reproductive behavior (number of births and abortions). Women, and especially those who have young children to care for, appear to be more at risk for the observed health effects. The evidence for a higher vulnerability in other risk groups (e.g., former psychiatric patients remains inconclusive). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Depression and quality of life among pregnant women in first and third trimesters in Abeokuta: A comparative study
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: Pregnancy is a dynamic time during which a woman's emotional state may undergo extensive change. There have been conflicting views about the magnitude of emotional turmoil that occurs during pregnancy. Some investigators suggest that pregnancy is a time of particularly good psychological adjustment; others have reported high levels of psychological challenge.
   Aim: Our study aimed to compare the prevalence and correlates of depression in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy and to determine the relationship between quality of life and depressive disorder.
   Setting: The antenatal clinic of the State Hospital, Ijaiye.
   Method: A descriptive, comparative study of depressive disorder and the quality of life between first- and third-trimester pregnant women (confirmed through a pregnancy test and an abdominopelvic ultrasound).
   Result: For each trimester, 285 participants were recruited. The prevalence of depression among the pregnant women who participated in the study was 7.2%. In the first trimester of pregnancy, the prevalence of depression was 30 (10.5%), while it was 11 (3.9%) in the third trimester of pregnancy. Collectively, the relationship between depression and QoL was significant in the overall domain, satisfaction with general health domain (t = 2.27; p = 0.03), psychological domain (t = 2.74; p = 0.010, and environmental domain (t = 4.57; p <= 0.01).
   Conclusion: Our study also highlights the need to pay closer attention to the psychological well-being and quality of life of all pregnant women and not just on their physical health and the baby's well-being.

TI  - Comparison of pain, cortisol levels, and psychological distress in women undergoing surgical termination of pregnancy under local anaesthesia versus intravenous sedation
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: The weight of evidence suggests that women who freely choose to terminate a pregnancy are unlikely to experience significant mental health risks, however some studies have documented psychological distress in the form of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression in the aftermath of termination. Choice of anaesthetic has been suggested as a determinant of outcome. This study compared the effects of local anaesthesia and intravenous sedation, administered for elective surgical termination, on outcomes of pain, cortisol, and psychological distress.
   Methods: 155 women were recruited from a private abortion clinic and state hospital ( mean age: 25.4 +/- 6.1 years) and assessed on various symptom domains, using both clinician-administered interviews and self-report measures just prior to termination, immediately post-procedure, and at 1 month and 3 months post-procedure. Morning salivary cortisol assays were collected prior to anaesthesia and termination.
   Results: The group who received local anaesthetic demonstrated higher baseline cortisol levels ( mean = 4.7 vs 0.2), more dissociative symptoms immediately post-termination ( mean = 14.7 vs 7.3), and higher levels of pain before ( mean = 4.9 vs 3.0) and during the procedure ( mean = 8.0 vs 4.4). However, in the longer-term ( 1 and 3 months), there were no significant differences in pain, psychological outcomes ( PTSD, depression, self-esteem, state anxiety), or disability between the groups. More than 65% of the variance in PTSD symptoms at 3 months could be explained by baseline PTSD symptom severity and disability, and post-termination dissociative symptoms. Of interest was the finding that pre-procedural cortisol levels were positively correlated with PTSD symptoms at both 1 and 3 months.
   Conclusion: High rates of PTSD characterise women who have undergone surgical abortions ( almost one fifth of the sample meet criteria for PTSD), with women who receive local anaesthetic experiencing more severe acute reactions. The choice of anesthetic, however, does not appear to impact on longer-term psychiatric outcomes or functional status.

TI  - Risk factors for low birthweight in the public-hospitals at Peshawar, NWFP-Pakistan
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Low birthweight is a widely used indicator of newborn health. This study investigates the association of birthweight < 2.5 kg (LBW) with a wide range of factors related to geo-demographics, maternal health and pregnancy history in public hospitals at Peshawar, North West Frontier Province (NWFP) Pakistan. It is noted that that Low birthweight may arise for two different reasons, one related to gestational age and the other corresponding to births that are small for gestational age (SGA).
   Methods: Data on geo-demographics, maternal health indicators, pregnancy history and outcome scores for newborn babies and their families (n = 1039) were collected prospectively between August and November 2003 in a cross-sectional survey of four public hospitals in Peshawar, NWFP-Pakistan. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were used to investigate the factors affecting incidence of LBW, by multivariate logistic regression. Gestational age was included as an explanatory variable therefore the additional covariates identified by model selection are expected to account for SGA.
   Results: The main geo-demographic risk factors for SGA identified in this study, controlling for gestational age of less than 37 weeks, are maternal age, nationality and consanguinity. Presentation with anaemia and the history of previous abortion/miscarriage were also found to be significant independent factors. The adjusted odds ratio for gestational age showed the largest effect in explaining the incidence of LBW. The next highest odds ratio was for maternal age below 20 years. The explanatory model included two pairwise interactions, for which the predicted incidence figures for LBW show an increase among the Tribal area with presentation of anaemia, and among full term babies with their mothers having a previous history of abortion/miscarriage.
   Conclusion: In addition to gestational age, specific factors related to geo-demographics (maternal age, consanguinity and nationality), maternal health (anaemia) and pregnancy history (abortion/miscarriage) were significantly associated with the incidence of LBW observed at the four hospitals surveyed in Peshawar. These results indicate that cultural factors can adversely affect the incidence of SGA in this area of Pakistan.

TI  - Idealized cultural beliefs about gender: implications for mental health
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - In this paper, we examined the relationship between culture-specific ideals (chastity, masculinity, caste beliefs) and self-esteem, shame and depression using an idealized cultural model proposed by Mahalingam (2006, In: Mahalingam R (ed) Cultural psychology of immigrants. Lawrence Erlbaum, Mahwah, NJ, pp 1-14).
   Participants were from communities with a history of extreme male-biased sex ratios in Tamilnadu, India (N = 785).
   We hypothesized a dual-process model of self-appraisals suggesting that achieving idealized cultural identities would increase both self-esteem and shame, with the latter leading to depression, even after controlling for key covariates. We tested this using structural equation modeling. The proposed idealized cultural identities model had an excellent fit (CFI = 0.99); the effect of idealized identities on self-esteem, shame and depression differed by gender.
   Idealized beliefs about gender relate to psychological well-being in gender specific ways in extreme son preference communities. We discuss implications of these findings for future research and community-based interventions.

TI  - Sexual Health and Multiple Forms of Discrimination Among Heterosexual Youth
T2  - SOCIAL PROBLEMS
AB  - Research suggests that inequality in material conditions contributes greatly to disparities in sexual health among youth; however, scholars have overlooked the effect of one manifestation of social disadvantage-interpersonal discrimination-on sexual health. This article uses data from a nationally representative survey of 15 to 25 year olds (N = 955) to investigate the relationship between interpersonal discrimination and sexual health among heterosexual youth. I examine whether exposure to multiple forms of discrimination (e.g., race and gender) is associated with risky sexual behaviors, as well as STI history, teenage pregnancy, and abortion history. The findings suggest that experiences of multiple forms of discrimination are associated with sexual activity, including early sexual debut and multiple sexual partners. However, discrimination is not linked with condom and contraceptive use, or the negative outcomes of (risky) sexual activity. These findings emphasize the importance of examining, rather than presuming, risk associated with youths' sexual activity.

TI  - Research progress of endometrial receptivity in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY AND ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a neuroendocrine heterogeneous disease that frequently occurs in women of reproductive age, causing serious damage to the fertility, quality of life, and physical and mental health of patients. The current studies have proved that satisfactory endometrial receptivity is one of the conditions that must be met during the process of spermatovum position, adhesion and invasion, as well as the subsequent blastocyst division and embryo development. Women with PCOS may suffer a series of pathological processes such as changes in the expression levels of hormones and related receptors, imbalances in the proportion of miscellaneous cytokines, insulin resistance, low-grade chronic inflammation and endometrial morphological changes, which will damage endometrial receptivity from various aspects and obstruct fertilized egg nidation and embryonic development, thus causing adverse reproductive health events including infertility and abortion. This article reviews the research progress about characteristics and related influencing factors of endometrial receptivity in PCOS patients.

TI  - Ethical Considerations for Psychologists Taking a Public Stance on Controversial Issues: The Balance Between Personal and Professional Life
T2  - ETHICS & BEHAVIOR
AB  - Previous literature has documented the general issues psychologists often face while balancing their personal and professional lives. The struggle stems from attempting to satisfy the need to maintain a life outside of work while having the professional obligation to follow the American Psychological Association's (APA's) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (Ethics Code) to prevent their personal lives from interfering with their professional roles and relationships. The present article analyzes the subject of psychologists taking a public position on controversial public issues. Although the APA Ethics Code does not restrict how psychologists conduct themselves during their personal time, taking a public stance on a controversial issue could potentially strain professional relationships and inadvertently reflect negatively on the profession. The present article examines ethical issues that (a) should be taken into account before psychologists take a public position on a controversial issue and (b) are in conflict with APA's Ethics Code or current research.

TI  - Spare Rib, The British Women's Health Movement and the Empowerment of Misery
T2  - SOCIAL HISTORY OF MEDICINE
AB  - This article elucidates Spare Rib's (1972-1993) value as a source for considering the UK women's health movement of the 1970s and 1980s. It focusses on the magazine's role in mediating and shaping its readers' relationship to negative bodily experience, and outlines its distinctiveness within the broader feminist landscape of women's health coverage. While aspects of the British women's health movement have attracted scholarly attention, such as mental health activism and abortion campaigns, we still know relatively little about how non-activist British women interpreted their bodily experiences and health through the feminist lens offered from the early 1970s. The first part of the article focusses on Spare Rib's contribution to the British women's health movement. The second part of the article zooms in on a selection of letters that show how readers took up, and found empowerment, in modes of bodily disclosure fostered by the magazine.

TI  - Medical Termination Of Pregnancy For Psychosocial Reasons
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY OBSTETRICS AND HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB  - The requesting of medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) for psychosocial reasons invites several questions concerning progress in medicine as well raising necessary and legitimate ethical questions. The law currently permits MTP for maternal reasons at any stage of pregnancy if the woman's health is at a significant risk. However, conceptions of mental health risks remain a grey area and present difficulties in terms of psychiatric assessment. When dealing with a patient suffering from a psychiatric disorder, questions must be asked on the reasons behind the request as well as questions concerning free and clear consent. It must also be taken into account that the progressive nature of pregnancy means patient care must be provided relatively quickly. These cases invite discussion on medical decisions, on both a moral and rational level, and the legitimacy of the basis on which the medical decision is taken in the context of MTP for psychosocial reasons.

TI  - Gender-based violence - Concepts, methods, and findings
T2  - VIOLENCE AND EXPLOITATION AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
CP  - Conference on Violence and Exploitation Against Women and Girls
AB  - The United Nations has identified gender-based violence against women as a global health and development issue, and a host of policies, public education, and action programs aimed at reducing gender-based violence have been undertaken around the world. This article highlights new conceptualizations, methodological issues, and selected research findings that can inform such activities. In addition to describing recent research findings that document relationships between gender, power, sexuality, and intimate violence cross-nationally, it identifies cultural factors, including linkages between sex and violence through media images that may increase women's risk for violence, and profiles a host of negative physical, mental, and behavioral health outcomes associated with victimization including unwanted pregnancy and abortion. More research is needed to identify the causes, dynamics, and outcomes of gender-based violence, including media effects, and to articulate how different forms of such violence vary in outcomes depending on cultural context.

TI  - International comparison of studies using the perinatal grief scale: A decade of research on pregnancy loss
T2  - DEATH STUDIES
AB  - The Perinatal Grief Scale (PGS) has been used in many studies of loss in pregnancy, including miscarriage, stillbirth, induced abortion, neonatal death, and relinquishment for adoption. This article describes 22 studies from 4 countries that used tire PGS with a total of 2485 participants. Studies that report Cronbach's alpha for their own samples give evidence of very high internal consistency reliability. Evidence for the validity of the PGS is also reviewed, such as convergent validity seen in its association with measures of mental health, social support, and marital satisfaction. The standard errors of the means for the total scale and for the subscales reveal fairly consistent scores, in spire of very different samples and types of loss; computation of means and standard deviations for the studies as a whole permits us to establish normal score ranges. Significantly higher scores were found in studies that recruited participants from support groups and self-selected populations rather than from medical sources, and from U.S. studies compared with those in Europe.

TI  - Children's Experiences After the Unintended Birth of a Sibling
T2  - DEMOGRAPHY
AB  - This study examines whether children with a younger sibling whose birth was unintended experience larger declines in the quality of their home environment and larger increases in behavioral problems than children whose younger sibling's birth was intended. We use data from the NLSY79 to estimate cross-lag regression models that assess changes in the home environment and children's behavioral problems after the birth of a sibling (intended or unintended). Results are consistent with our hypotheses, finding that, indeed, unintended births have negative spillover effects. Compared with children whose sibling's birth was intended, both boys and girls whose sibling's birth was unintended experienced larger declines in the quality of their home environment, and boys had larger increases in behavioral problems. We also find some unexpected evidence that mistimed births may have larger negative effects than unwanted births. This deserves further research, and we offer some possible explanations that could guide those investigations.

TI  - Is intimate partner violence associated with unintended pregnancy? A review of the literature
T2  - TRAUMA VIOLENCE & ABUSE
AB  - Although a substantial body of literature explores the adverse physical and mental health consequences associated with intimate partner violence, only a limited body of international research has explored the effect of intimate partner violence on women's fertility control. Yet a compelling argument can be made of the indirect mechanism through which the climate of fear and control surrounding abusive relationships could limit women's ability to control their fertility. Lack of fertility control can lead to unintended pregnancies, which are also associated with adverse outcomes for women's and infant health, especially in developing countries. The association between intimate partner violence and unintended pregnancy also suggests serious social effects spawned by a cycle of unintended childbearing in abusive households. Therefore, further investigation is warranted to explore the nature of the association as well as the mechanisms through which these phenomena operate in the United States and in developing countries.

TI  - Midwives holding the space for women undergoing termination of pregnancy: A qualitative inquiry
T2  - WOMEN AND BIRTH
AB  - Problem: Hospital midwives are the main care givers for women undergoing termination of pregnancy after 20 weeks. Midwives' role and potential impact of regular involvement in termination of pregnancy (TOP) are poorly understood. Setting: New Zealand. Background: TOP after 20 weeks may be performed to save a woman's life or preserve her physical and mental health. Throughout the process midwives play a key role in supporting women's complex psychological and clinical needs. Objective: To gain a deeper understanding of the role of midwives in TOP care after 20 weeks, including the support they might need and the impacts caring for women who are having a TOP may have on them. Methods: Eight midwives from two District Health Boards were interviewed about their experiences of caring for women having a TOP after 20 weeks. Transcripts were analysed by applying a hermeneuticphenomenological lens. Findings: Three themes emerged: "A different kind of midwife", "Staying true to oneself" and "Melting an Iceberg". TOP care is a different role within midwifery as midwives facilitate death in the space of birth. Immersing themselves in women's emotional space they create meaningful connections to support their complex needs and provide a positive birth experience. Yet, midwives are unprepared for the emotional effects of repeatedly caring for women undergoing TOP. Lacking appropriate support they can experience increasing, lasting grief. Conclusion: Midwives' experiences of providing TOP care are complex, intense and have lifelong impact. Their role in the context of TOP is highly specialised and must be valued and supported.

TI  - Psychiatric disorders following fetal death: a population-based cohort study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives: Women have increased risks of severe mental disorders after childbirth and death of a child, but it remains unclear whether this association also applies to fetal loss and, if so, to which extent. We studied the risk of any inpatient or outpatient psychiatric treatment during the time period from 12 months before to 12 months after fetal death.
   Design: Cohort study using Danish population-based registers.
   Setting: Denmark.
   Participants: A total of 1 112 831 women born in Denmark from 1960 to 1995 were included. In total, 87 687cases of fetal death (International Classification of Disease-10 codes for spontaneous abortion or stillbirth) were recorded between 1996 and 2010.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: The main outcome measures were incidence rate ratios (risk of first psychiatric inpatient or outpatient treatment).
   Results: A total of 1379 women had at least one psychiatric episode during follow-up from the year before fetal death to the year after. Within the first few months after the loss, women had an increased risk of psychiatric contact, IRR: 1.51 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.99). In comparison, no increased risk of psychiatric contact was found for the period before fetal death. The risk of experiencing a psychiatric episode was highest for women with a loss occurring after 20 weeks of gestation (12 month probability: 1.95%, 95% CI 1.50 to 2.39).
   Conclusions: Fetal death was associated with a transient increased risk of experiencing a first-time episode of a psychiatric disorder, primarily adjustment disorders. The risk of psychiatric episodes tended to increase with increasing gestational age at the time of the loss.

TI  - Paternal postnatal depression: prevalence and the associated demographic and maternal reproductive factors among Iranian fathers
T2  - JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE AND INFANT PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundPaternal postnatal depression (PPND) is a critical mental health issue that may harm family members' health and relationships. The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) is the most common self-reported questionnaire for postnatal depression screening among mothers and fathers worldwide. However, identifying fathers with postnatal depression and determining the related factors have been neglected in some countries.AimsThe present study aimed to determine the prevalence of PPND and then to identify its predictive demographic and reproductive factors. Two cut-off points (10 and 12) for the EPDS were used to detect PPND.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 eligible fathers selected via multistage sampling. Data were collected using a demographic checklist and the EPDS.ResultsNone of the participants had previously been screened for PPND. The mean age of the participants was 35.53 +/- 5.47 years, and most of them were self-employed and had university degrees. The prevalence of PPND was 24.5% and 16.3% using the EPDS cut-off scores 10 and 12, respectively. An unwanted pregnancy and an abortion history were the predictors of PPND at both EPDS cut-off scores, with gravidity and the number of abortions also being associated with PPND at the cut-off score of 10.ConclusionIn line with the related literature, our results revealed a fairly high prevalence of PPND and its related factors. This indicates the need for a screening program for fathers during the postnatal period to detect and adequately manage PPND and prevent its adverse effects.

TI  - Minor depressive disorder in the context of miscarriage
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Although minor depressive disorder is of considerable clinical and public health importance, it has received limited research attention relative to major depressive disorder. This study examines the incidence rate and relative risk for minor depressive disorder following miscarriage. Methods: Using a cohort design we tested whether miscarrying women are at increased risk for an episode of minor depression (diagnosed based on research criteria proposed in Appendix B of DSM-IV) in the 6 months following loss. The miscarriage cohort consisted of women attending a medical center for spontaneous abortion (n = 229): the comparison group was a population-based cohort of women drawn from the community (n = 230). Results: Among miscarrying women, 5.2% experienced an episode of minor depression, compared with 1.0% of community women. The overall relative risk for an episode of minor depression for miscarrying women was 5.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-23.6). Relative risk did not vary by length of gestation at the time of loss or attitude toward the pregnancy. The majority of episodes in miscarrying women began within 1 month following loss. Limitations: Minor depression was relatively rare in both study cohorts. The resulting limits on statistical power reduced our ability to identify factors, such as sociodemographic or reproductive history variables that might moderate the effect of miscarriage on risk for minor depression. Conclusions: These results, in the context of prior work showing increased risks of major depression and depressive symptoms following miscarriage, lend some support to the conceptualization of minor depressive disorder as part of a continuum of symptom severity. Miscarrying women should be evaluated for depression at their follow-up medical visits. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the degree of possible misreporting is unclear, as little research has compared prospective and retrospective reports of intention for the same pregnancies.
   METHODS Longitudinal data collected between 2010 and 2015 on 174 pregnancies were used to analyze the magnitude and direction of changes in intendedness (intended, ambivalent or unintended) between prospective and retrospective measurements of intendedness using versions of the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP). Changes were assessed both continuously and categorically. Differences in the degree of change-by pregnancy outcome and participant characteristics-were examined using mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models.
   RESULTS Over two and one-half years of follow-up, 143 participants reported 174 pregnancies. Approximately half showed changes in intention between the prospective and retrospective assessments, with 38% of participants reporting increased intendedness and 10% decreased intendedness. Reported intendedness increased more among those who gave birth (mean change in continuous LMUP score, 2.2) than among those who obtained an abortion (0.7), as well as among individuals with a college degree (4.1) than among those with a high school diploma (1.2). Participants who reported recent depression or anxiety symptoms showed more stable intentions (0.02) than those who did not (2.1).
   CONCLUSIONS Retrospective measurement of pregnancy intentions may underestimate the frequency of unintended pregnancy, with such underestimation being greater among certain subgroups. Estimates based on retrospective reports thus may produce inaccurate impressions of intentionality. Further efforts to refine the measurement of pregnancy preferences are needed.

TI  - The Impact of Militarism, Patriarchy, and Culture on Israeli Women's Reproductive Health and Well-Being
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - In this paper, we situate and frame Israeli women's reproductive health within the social, historical, political, cultural, and geographical context of Israeli women's lives.
   We used a theoretical review in this paper.
   Militarism, patriarchy, and cultural values heavily shape and influence Jewish and Arab women's access to and experience of reproductive health when it comes to the imperative to have children, pregnancy, birth, access to contraception and abortion, and other reproductive healthcare services. We discuss five main factors pertaining to Israeli women's reproductive health including (1) fertility and emphasis on reproduction; (2) infertility; (3) pregnancy, birth, and miscarriage; (4) reproductive rights including contraception and abortion; and (5) maternity leave and accessible childcare.
   Israel is a pro-natalist country, in which both Jewish and Arab women share many of the consequences of the social imperative to have children. Though Arab women, as part of their double minority status, are exposed to more mental health risks pre- and postpartum, the personal and public reproductive health decisions and reproductive healthcare services are largely shaped by similar social forces. These include the patriarchal and religious culture that dictates a value system that highly cherishes motherhood, and within the military political context of the on-going Israeli-Palestinian conflict and past social and political traumas. We address four major gaps that need to be addressed in order to improve Israeli women's reproductive health and well-being that include the neoliberal gap, the information gap, the reproductive health services gap, and the leadership and policy gap.

TI  - Suicidal behavior in pregnant teenagers in southern Brazil: Social, obstetric and psychiatric correlates
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Suicidal behavior and its correlates remain relatively understudied in pregnant teenagers.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study with a consecutive sample of pregnant teenagers recipient of prenatal medical assistance by the national public health system in the urban area of Pelotas, southern Brazil. Sample size was estimated in 871 participants. Suicidal behavior and psychiatric disorders were assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview; the Abuse Assessment Screen was used to identify physical or sexual abuse; social support was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Survey Social Support Scale; a self-report questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic, obstetric and other psychosocial data.
   Results: Forty three (4.94%) teenagers refused to participate, resulting in 828 participants. Prevalence of suicidal behavior was 13.3%; lifetime suicide attempts were referred by 7.4%, with 1.3% reporting attempting suicide within the last month. After adjustment, we found significant associations of suicidal behavior with the 18-19 years old subgroup, low education, prior abortion, previous major depression, and physical abuse within the last 12 months. Pregnant teenagers with high social support showed prevalence ratios (PR) 67% lower (PR: 0.33; 95%CI: 0.19-0.56) than those with low social support. Furthermore, a wide range of psychiatric disorders, most notably major depressive disorder (PR: 2.75; 95%CI: 1.34-5.63) and panic disorder (PR: 6.36; 95%CI: 1.61-25.10), remained associated with suicidal behavior after adjustment. Limitations: The cross-sectional design precludes causal inferences.
   Conclusions: We found that suicidal behavior is a relatively common feature in pregnant teenagers, frequently associated with psychiatric disorders. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Considering abortion: a 12-month audit of records of women contacting a Pregnancy Advisory Service
T2  - MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
AB  - Objective: To characterise the demographic and psychosocial circumstances of women contacting Victoria's largest public pregnancy advisory service (PAS).
   Design and setting: Audit of PAS electronic records for the 12 months from 1 October 2006 to 30 September 2007. De-identified data were extracted from a comprehensive electronic database used for recording consultations.
   Main outcome measures: Summary statistics and measures of association.
   Results: During the 12 months, 5462 women contacted PAS; records were created for 3827 women, and data were available in more than 80% of records for 77% (13/17) of items. Over half of the women receiving pregnancy support from PAS (60%) were 18-29 years old; 12% lived outside the metropolitan area; 51% held a health care card, and smaller percentages faced housing, financial, or drug and alcohol problems; 16% reported violence, but 71 % described partners as involved and supportive. Most (79%) made contact within 2 weeks of discovering pregnancy, and 72% were referred by a general practitioner. Later gestation at contact was associated with younger age (P < 0.001), having a health care card (P < 0.001), and living outside the metropolitan area (P < 0.001). The most common reasons for seeking abortion were the desire to delay pregnancy (23%) and family completion (18%); 42% already had at least one child. Twenty-three women reported that the pregnancy was the result of rape. Ten per cent had mental health problems, and smaller numbers faced access barriers and had special needs.
   Conclusions: This PAS responds to demand from women with diverse social and personal circumstances. Findings provide evidence for policy, prevention and service development.

TI  - Anxiety disorders following miscarriage
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: Several previous studies have established that miscarriage is a risk factor for depressive symptoms and disorder. By contrast, research on miscarriage as a possible risk factor for anxiety symptoms is inconclusive, and for anxiety disorders, sparse and uninformative. The current study examines the incidence of and relative risk fur 3 DSM-III anxiety disorders (obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD], panic disorder, and phobic disorders) within the 6 months following miscarriage. Adequate diagnostic data on other anxiety disorders were not available.
   Method: Using a cohort design, we tested whether women who miscarry are at increased risk for a first or recurrent episode of an anxiety disorder in the 6 months following loss. The miscarriage cohort consisted of women attending a medical center for spontaneous abortion (N = 229); the comparison group was a population-based cohort of women drawn from the community (N = 230).
   Results: Among miscarrying women, 3.5% experienced a recurrent episode of OCD, compared with 0.4% of community women (relative risk [RR] = 8.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0 to 63.7). The relative risk for nonco-morbid panic disorder was substantial (RR = 3.6), albeit not statistically significant (95% CI = 0.8 to 17.2). There was no strong evidence for increased risk fur phobic disorders or agoraphobia, combined or considered separately, in the 6 months following loss. Relative risk for all 3 disorders combined was 1.5 (95% CI = 0.9 to 2.3).
   Conclusion: In this first miscarriage cohort study using a concurrent frequency-matched comparison group, miscarriage was a substantial risk factor for an initial or recurrent episode of OCD. Given statistical power limitations of this investigation, the current findings do not preclude a possible contribution of miscarriage to risk for other anxiety disorders.

TI  - Ectogenesis and a right to the death of the prenatal human being: A reply to Rasanen
T2  - BIOETHICS
AB  - Both defenders and critics of abortion have taken up the question: could artificial wombs end the abortion debate? If the prenatal human being, a member of the biological species homo sapiens, is removed from the uterus, an unwanted pregnancy would be over. This outcome is pleasing to those who advocate for a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. If the living prenatal human being is then placed in an advanced incubator (artificial womb), then no human being dies. This outcome is pleasing to those who advocate for the human right to live of prenatal human beings. The 'win-win' scenario of artificial wombs rather than ending the life of the prenatal human being has been endorsed by a number of authors on all sides of the abortion debate. In his article, Ectogenesis, abortion and a right to the death of the fetus, Joona Rasanen challenges this view by providing three arguments for a right to secure the death of the human being in utero. On his view, abortion includes the right to the death of the gestating human being, not merely a removal from the uterus. First, he offers the 'right not to become a biological parent argument'. Rasanen states it as follows:Becoming a biological parent causes harm to the couple because of parental obligations towards the child.The couple has the interest to avoid the harm of parental obligations.Therefore, the couple has a right to the death of the fetus to avoid the harm of parental obligations. This argument is logically invalid. The phrase 'a right to the death of the fetus' appears in neither the major nor in the minor premise, so it cannot appear like a rabbit out of a hat in the conclusion. So, even if both premises were true, they do not provide a justification for the conclusion. New versions of the right not to become a biological parent argument could be made making use of either one of the two original premises. For example, a new valid version of the right not to become a biological parent argument could be stated as follows:If the couple has the interest to avoid the harm of parental obligations, then the couple has a right to the death of the fetus to avoid the harm of parental obligations.The couple has the interest to avoid the harm of parental obligations.Therefore, the couple has a right to the death of the fetus to avoid the harm of parental obligations. A similar reconstruction could be made making use of the other original premise, 'Becoming a biological parent causes harm to the couple because of parental obligations towards the child.' So, let us consider both original premises. Does Rasanen give us good reason to think that both premises are true? The reason given for the first premise, becoming a biological parent causes harm to the couple because of parental obligations towards the child, is that 'parents would still feel morally responsible for the child, which then could cause them significant psychological harm'. This reason does not provide justification for the premise. To say something could cause harm does not show that something does cause harm. Moreover, Rasanen provides no empirical evidence that becoming a biological parent could cause them significant psychological harm. On the contrary, many people report that unplanned parenthood turned out to be not a curse, but rather a great gift in their lives. Almost all parents view their own children, whatever the circumstances of their conception, as an unambiguous blessing rather than as a harm.
   But the case that Rasanen has in mind is not parents who raise their children who were conceived in unplanned ways, but rather biological parents who place their children into another family via adoption. Would parents who place their children for adoption after ectogenesis experience psychological burdens from making that choice and knowing that their biological offspring was being raised by someone else? It is difficult to answer this question because we have no empirical evidence about the psychological effects of currently non-existent ectogenesis. Even if some birth mothers now experience trauma in placing a child for adoption, this would not show that ectogenesis leads to trauma. It could be that after 9 months of pregnancy, psychological bonds develop such that adoption becomes traumatic. It could be that the social aspects of pregnancy, the knowledge of other people about a women's pregnancy, make adoption at 9 months difficult. If ectogenesis is used a short time after pregnancy is detected, there may not be sufficient time to develop such bonds or for the social aspects of pregnancy to be relevant. So, it could turn out that full-term birth, but not ectogenesis, leads to trauma. In fact, the evidence suggests that it is not becoming a biological parent but getting an abortion that can cause significant psychological harm. In several studies, David M. Fergusson, professor of psychology at the University of Otago, has noted that abortion itself is a risk factor for psychological harm. Lest the credibility of these studies be called into question because it is assumed that this psychologist is religious and pro-life, Dr. Fergusson describes himself as an atheist and pro-choice. After doing his research, he said, We were indeed surprised by the results. Our expectation was that we would find that young women who had abortions had higher rates, but that was due to selection factors, that is the background of young women predisposed them both to abortion and to mental health problems, and we found that that was not in fact the case. So, if we are focusing on avoiding the risk of substantial psychological harm, it is not biological parenthood we should avoid, but abortion. Another problematic element of the right not to become a biological parent argument is its internal inconsistency about parenthood. Rasanen writes, 'In this article, I use the terms genetic parent and biological parent as synonyms.' He holds that, 'There is a right to the death of the fetus because gestating a fetus in an artificial womb when genetic parents refuse it violates their rights not to become a biological parent.' But someone who already is a biological parent cannot have the right not to become a biological parent. Rights have to do with choices that are possible. But someone who already is a biological parent to an individual cannot become a biological parent to that individual. Once a human being has been conceived, the man and the woman have already become biological/genetic parents, so the opportunity to exercise the putative right not to become a genetic/biological parent has passed-that ship has sailed. Someone might posit a right not to remain a biological parent, a modern Patria potestas, but that is presumably a different kind of claim. It is also hard to see how the right not to remain a biological parent can be squared with the legal and ethical responsibilities that biological parents are thought to have to their vulnerable, dependent children.
   Indeed, it is plausible to hold that parental rights arise because of parental duties. Parents cannot discharge their duties to care for and keep safe their children unless they have special rights to control their children that others do not have. For this reason, parents who fail in their parental duties (by endangering or even intentionally harming their children) sometimes have their parental rights terminated. If parental duties circumscribe and ground parental rights, parental rights cannot justify actions that contradict parental duties to care for and, above all, not harm vulnerable, dependent children. Let us now consider the 'right to genetic privacy argument'. Rasanen articulates this argument as follows:People have a right to genetic privacy.Ectogenesis abortion violates the genetic privacy of the genetic parents of the fetus.Therefore, genetic parents have a right to the death of the fetus. This argument is logically invalid. The phrase 'a right to the death of the fetus' does not appear in either of the premises, but arrives via a non sequitur in the conclusion. New versions of the right to genetic privacy argument could be made making use of either one of the two original premises. For example, we could revise the right to genetic privacy argument as follows:If ectogenesis abortion violates the genetic privacy of the genetic parents of the fetus, then genetic parents have a right to the death of the fetus.Ectogenesis abortion violates the genetic privacy of the genetic parents of the fetus.Therefore, genetic parents have a right to the death of the fetus. This new version of the right to genetic privacy argument is logically valid. We could construct another new version of the right to genetic privacy argument making use of the other original premise, 'people have a right to genetic privacy'. The question then arises, are either of the original premises of the right to genetic privacy argument true? An example given by Rasanen to illustrate a right to genetic privacy seems intuitively plausible to me. If someone steals my genetic material in order to make a clone of me, and gestates that cloned individual via ectogenesis, that person wrongs me in a significant way. Rasanen takes a large step beyond this intuition, saying that, 'Therefore, in such a case, I have a right to the death of the fetus.' But it does not follow from the premise that I have been wronged in the 'stolen genetic material case' that I have a right to the death of the cloned individual. After all, suppose I found out that my genetic material had been stolen and I had been cloned 10 years after the cloning took place? Surely, Rasanen does not believe that I would be justified in killing my fifth-grade clone. So, it does not follow from the intuition that I have been wronged in the stolen genetic material case that I have a right to the death of an individual made from my stolen genetic material. Moreover, our shared intuition about the stolen genetic material case justifies only the relatively weak claim that in some cases people have a right to genetic privacy. The stolen genetic material case does not show the stronger claim that in all cases people have a right to genetic privacy. But the right to genetic privacy argument needs the stronger claim. After all, if, in some cases people have a right to genetic privacy and in some cases they do not, then it could be that ectogenesis is a case in which people do not have a right to genetic privacy.
   Rasanen has not provided any reason to think that the stronger claim is true. Another difficulty with Rasanen's overall case for securing the death of the fetus is that the right to genetic privacy argument is incompatible with the right not to become a biological parent argument. One cannot consistently assert both arguments because the premises of these arguments are contradictory. The right not to become a biological parent argument is based on the premise that 'becoming a biological parent causes harm to the couple because of parental obligations towards the child'. The right to genetic privacy argument is based on the premise that 'ectogenesis abortion violates the genetic privacy of the genetic parents of the fetus'. Recall that for Rasanen the terms genetic parent and biological parent are synonyms. So, according to the first argument, the man and woman in question are not yet biological parents, so they can kill the fetal human being to prevent themselves from becoming biological parents. In the second argument, the man and woman are already biological parents, so they can kill the fetal human being. Are the man and the woman biological or genetic parents of this prenatal son or daughter? If we answer affirmatively, the first argument fails. If we answer negatively, the second argument fails. But whether we answer affirmatively or negatively, the two arguments are incompatible with one another for they embody contradictory understandings of when genetic/biological parenthood begins. A third argument, called 'the right to property argument', is formulated by Rasanen as follows:The fetus is property of the genetic parents.People can destroy their property.Therefore, genetic parents can destroy their fetus. This argument is logically invalid. Exemplifying the four-term fallacy, the right to property argument is a syllogism with more than three terms, namely 'the fetus', 'property of the genetic parents', 'people', 'can destroy their property', 'genetic parents' and 'can destroy their fetus'. The right to property argument also commits the fallacy of undistributed middle, since the middle term 'property' is not distributed. Finally, the term 'genetic parents' is distributed in the conclusion but not in the premise, an example of the fallacy of the minor term. A new version of the right to property argument could be formulated as follows:If the fetus is property of the genetic parents, the genetic parents may destroy their fetus.The fetus is property of the genetic parents.Therefore, genetic parents may destroy their fetus. This version of the right to property argument is logically valid. But are both premises of the revised right to property argument true? The second premise is deeply questionable. 'Parent' is a relational term. There is no such thing as a parent without a child. If there is a human parent, there is also a human child. The relationship of parent to child is not the relationship of owner to property. For this reason, critics of abortion speak of the 'unborn child' but defenders of abortion do not for they (rightly) note that the term is question begging. The parent-child relationship is not a neutral, biological categorization, but rather a morally loaded way of speaking of a relationship that suggests that the parents ought to provide for their vulnerable child.
   But if it is implicitly admitted that a child is present, then a crucial premise of the pro-life argument is admitted. No human child is the property of another, and parents in particular owe their own dependent progeny treatment not as objects to be destroyed but children to be cherished. Moreover, the conclusion of the right to property argument, 'genetic parents may destroy their fetus' is at odds with Rasanen's assertion that, 'I have not argued that biological parents have a right to kill the fetus, but that they have a right to the death of the fetus.' It is physically (and perhaps also metaphysically) impossible for someone to destroy the fetus but not kill the fetus. So, if Rasanen is right in his argument that genetic parents have a right to destroy their child, then Rasanen is wrong that he has not argued for a right to kill. Not the mother alone and not the father alone have the right to kill their son or daughter. Rasanen writes: I claim that the fetus is collective property of its genetic parents. When the genetic parents agree and they both want the death of the fetus or the destruction of the embryos, it is morally permissible for them to do so since they together share 100% of the fetus' or the embryos' genetic material, and gestating the fetus or the embryos against their consent violates their rights. This grounding for a right to kill the fetus echoes his earlier claim that people have their right to genetic privacy violated in cases in which there are 'genetic children out there who carry their genetic material without their consent'. Since both the mother and the father are the genetic parents, the right to genetic privacy is understood as a collective right, rather than as an individual right. Rasanen writes, 100% of the fetus' genetic material comes from its genetic parents. Because having a genetic child in the world who carries the genetic material of the parents without their consent is against their right to genetic privacy, the genetic parents together have a right to the death of the fetus. So, on his view, the mother alone or the father alone do not have a right to secure the death of their son or daughter but only both parents together. Now, by parity of reasoning, it is equally true that 100% of the fetus's genetic material comes from his or her genetic grandparents. Because having a genetic grandchild in the world who carries the genetic material of the grandparents without their consent is against their right to genetic privacy, the genetic grandparents together have a right to the death of the fetus. This is hard to believe. So, the fact that a child's genetic material comes 100% from some group of people is irrelevant to whether those people have a right, if they all agree, to the death of a child. Finally, neither parents nor grandparents should consider their child or grandchild their genetic property. Epigenetic factors are essential to how any particular genotype is expressed. So, a human individual has a uniquely expressed genotype that is not entirely derived from the parents or grandparents. Due to environmental factors, all human individuals (even those deriving from the same fertilized egg), have a unique expressed genotype. In conclusion, all three of Rasanen's arguments for the conclusion that the parents have a right to the death of their son or daughter fail.
   The right not to become a biological parent argument, the right to genetic privacy argument, and the right to property argument are all logically invalid. These arguments also make use of premises that are not consistent with each other. There is also reason to question whether all the premises of these arguments are true.

There are, of course, other arguments which, if correct, would secure the right of parents to secure the death of their fetus.

INTRODUCTION THE RIGHT NOT TO BECOME A BIOLOGICAL PARENT ARGUMENT THE RIGHT TO GENETIC PRIVACY ARGUMENT THE RIGHT TO PROPERTY ARGUMENT CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes Both many critics of abortion and many defenders of abortion have suggested that artificial wombs could end the abortion debate. If the fetus is removed from the uterus, women have an end to an unwanted pregnancy.
   If the living fetus is then put in an artificial uterus for ectogenesis, there is no termination of the life of the fetus. Joona Rasanen challenges this view in his article, Ectogenesis, abortion and a right to the death of the fetus. Rasanen provides three arguments for a right to secure the death of the human being in utero, namely the 'right not to become a biological parent argument', the 'right to genetic privacy argument', and the 'right to property argument'. This article critiques these three arguments for a right to the death of the fetus.

TI  - Antenatal depression among women with gestational diabetes mellitus: a pilot study
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Background Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is quite prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, and has been proposed to increase the risk of depression. There is only a prior study assessing antenatal depression among the subjects with GDM in the Bangladesh, which leads this study to be investigated. Objective To determine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and potential associations among pregnant women diagnosed with GDM. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out among 105 pregnant women diagnosed with GDM over the period of January to December 2017 in 4- hospitals located in two different cities (Dhaka and Barisal). A semi-structured questionnaire was developed consisting of items related to socio-demographics, reproductive health history, diabetes, anthropometrics, and depression. Results Mild to severe antenatal depression was present in 36.2% of the subjects (i.e., 14.3%, 19% and 2.9% for mild, moderate and severe depression, respectively). None of the socio-demographic factors were associated with depression, but the history of reproductive health-related issues (i.e., abortion, neonatal death) and uncontrolled glycemic status were associated with the increased risk of depressive disorders. Conclusions GDM is associated with a high prevalence of depressive symptoms, which is enhanced by poor diabetes control. Thus, in women presenting with GDM, screening for depression should be pursued and treated as needed.
   Plain English Summary Pregnancy is a highly stressful period in a woman's life that can also be associated with mental health problems such as depression. Depression is reported in about 16% of pregnant women whereas and such prevalence can double in LMICs (e.g., Bangladesh). In addition, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has emerged as a common condition affecting approximately 10% of all pregnancies. GDM has also been associated with adverse mental health outcomes, particularly depression. GDM women with antenatal depression are not only at increased risk of poorer quality of life, but are also at increased risk of adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes, particularly in LMIC. This study investigates the prevalence of depressive symptoms among Bangladeshi pregnant women diagnosed with GDM. It is found that depression was detectable in 36.2% subjects. In addition, a history of reproductive health-related issues (i.e., abortion, neonatal death) and uncontrolled glycemic status were associated with increased risk of depressive disorders. Considering the negative effects of both GDM and depression on pregnancy-related outcomes, early screening of these conditions should be pursued, preferably once every trimester over the duration of the pregnancy.

TI  - Brief Internet-Based Intervention Reduces Posttraumatic Stress and Prolonged Grief in Parents after the Loss of a Child during Pregnancy: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOSOMATICS
AB  - Background: The loss of a child during pregnancy causes significant psychological distress for many women and their partners, and may lead to long-lasting psychiatric disorders. Internet-based interventions using exposure techniques and cognitive restructuring have proved effective for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and prolonged grief. This study compared the effects of an Internet-based intervention for parents after prenatal loss with a waiting list condition (WLC). Methods: The Impact of Event Scale Revised assessed symptoms of PTSD; the Inventory of Complicated Grief and the Brief Symptom Inventory assessed depression, anxiety, and general mental health. The 228 participants (92% female) were randomly allocated to a treatment group (TG; n = 115) or a WLC group (n = 113). The TG received a 5-week cognitive behavioral intervention including (1) self-confrontation, (2) cognitive restructuring, and (3) social sharing. Results: The TG showed significantly reduced symptoms of posttraumatic stress, prolonged grief, depression, and anxiety relative to the WLC control group. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed treatment effects of between d = 0.84 and d = 1.02 for posttraumatic stress and prolonged grief from pre- to posttreatment time points. Further significant improvement in all symptoms of PTSD and prolonged grief was found from the posttreatment evaluation to the 12-month follow-up. The attrition rate of 14% was relatively low. Conclusions: The Internet-based intervention proved to be a feasible and cost-effective treatment, reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress, grief, depression, anxiety, and general mental health after pregnancy loss. Low-threshold e-health interventions should be further evaluated and implemented routinely to improve psychological support after pregnancy loss. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Posttraumatic stress disorder and pregnancy complications
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Objective: To assess the associations between specific pregnancy complications and posttraumatic stress disorder based on neurobiologic and behavioral characteristics, using Michigan Medicaid claims data from 1994-1996.
   Methods: Two thousand, two hundred nineteen female recipients of Michigan Medicaid who were of childbearing age had posttraumatic stress disorder on the basis of International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes. Twenty percent (n = 455) of those recipients and 30% of randomly selected comparison women with no mental health diagnostic codes (n = 638; P < .001) had ICD-9 diagnostic codes for pregnancy complications. We used multiple logistic regression to investigate associations between specific pregnancy complications and posttraumatic stress disorder, controlling for demographic and psychosocial variables. Obstetric complications were hypothesized based on high-risk behaviors and neurobiologic alterations in stress axis function in posttraumatic stress disorder.
   Results: After controlling for demographic and psychosocial factors, women with posttraumatic stress disorder had higher odds ratios (ORs) for ectopic pregnancy (OR 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1, 2.8), spontaneous abortion (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3, 2.91, hyperemesis (OR 3.9, 95% CI 2.0, 7.4), preterm contractions (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1, 1.9), and excessive fetal growth (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0, 2.2). Hypothesized labor differences were not confirmed and no differences were found for complications not thought to be related to traumatic stress.
   Conclusions: Pregnant women with posttraumatic stress disorder might be at higher risk for certain conditions, and assessment and treatment for undiagnosed posttraumatic stress might be warranted for women with those obstetric complications. Prospective studies are needed to confirm present findings and to determine potential biologic mechanisms. Treatment of traumatic stress symptoms might improve pregnancy morbidity and maternal mental health. (Obstet Gynecol 2001;97:17-22.

TI  - Effects of Health Status and Health Behaviors on Depression Among Married Female Immigrants in South Korea
T2  - ASIAN NURSING RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose: This study examined the effects of health status and health behaviors on depression in married female immigrants in South Korea.
   Methods: Sampling 316 immigrant women from the Philippines, Vietnam, China, and other Asian countries, a cross-sectional research design was used with self-report questionnaires that assessed sociodemographic characteristics, health status, health behaviors, and depression.
   Results: There were significant differences in stillbirth experience, induced abortion, morbidity, perceived health status, meal skipping, and physical activity between depressed and nondepressed immigrant women. After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, stillbirth experience, poorer perceived health status, more meal skipping, and less physical activity were associated with greater depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: Both health status and health behaviors had significant impacts on depression, suggesting that development of nursing interventions and educational programs should be targeted towards improving maternal health, healthy lifestyle, and subjective health perception to promote married female immigrants' psychological well-being.

TI  - Size at birth and cognitive function among rural adolescents: a life course epidemiology study protocol of the Kisalaya cohort in Mysuru, South India
T2  - BMJ PAEDIATRICS OPEN
AB  - IntroductionIt is proven that adverse intrauterine environment results in 'early life programming,' alterations in metabolism and physiological development of the fetus, often termed as 'Developmental Origins of Health and Disease' (DOHaD) resulting in a smaller size at birth, greater non-communicable diseases (NCD) risk factors during childhood and adolescence, and cardiometabolic disorders in adulthood. Nevertheless, very few studies have examined the relationship between DOHaD programming and cognition. This study aims to examine if impaired prenatal growth indicated by birth weight is associated with cognition among adolescents in the Kisalaya cohort, a rural birth cohort in South India, thus providing newer insights into DOHaD programming for adolescent mental health in a low-income and middle-income country setting.Methods and analysisKisalaya cohort was established in 2008, to provide integrated antenatal care and HIV testing using mobile clinics to improve maternal and child health outcomes. This cohort included pregnant women residing in 144 villages of Mysuru Taluk (rural) who received antenatal care through mobile clinics and delivered their children between 2008 and 2011. Data related to mother-infant dyads for all pregnant women who received care in the Kisalaya programme are available for this study. Presently, children born to women who received care through Kisalaya are adolescents between 10 and 12 years. At this point, information would be collected on sociodemographic data and assessments of mental health, stressful life events, cognition, vision, speech, language, hearing and anthropometric measures would be done and relevant maternal data and child data, available from the cohort would be retracted for analysis. We plan to retrace as many adolescents as possible out of 1544 adolescents who are currently available for study excluding twins, abortions, stillbirths and postdelivery deaths. Analyses will be extended to construct a life course pathway for cognition using structural equation modelling.

TI  - Mental health consequences of unintended childlessness and unplanned births: Gender differences and life course dynamics
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - The discordance between fertility intentions and outcomes may be associated with mental health in the general population. This requires data directly linking individuals' fertility intentions with their outcomes. This study brings together two streams of research on fertility and psychological distress to examine whether unintended childlessness and unplanned births are associated with psychological distress, compared with intended childlessness and planned births. We also examine whether unintended childlessness and unplanned births are differently associated with distress at two stages of the individuals' life course: in early and late 30s. As women are more directly affected by the decline in fertility with age and the experience of motherhood is more central to women's identity, we also examined gender differences in these associations. Thus, we examined the association between four possible fertility events (planned and unplanned births, intended and unintended childlessness) and psychological distress of men and women, at two different stages over the life course (early and late 30s). We used longitudinal data from the US National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979 (N=2524) to link individuals' fertility intentions and outcomes to evaluate the association of depressive symptoms (CES-D) with four possible fertility events occurring in two-year intervals, for men and women separately. Contrary to our first hypothesis, unintended childlessness and unplanned births were not associated with psychological distress for women. Among men, only unplanned births in their early 30s were associated with increases in psychological distress. We did not find support for our second hypothesis that unintended childlessness and unplanned births have a different association with psychological distress for men and women and as a function of the stage of life. These findings are discussed in the context of previous literature in this area. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Psychological consequences of rape on women in 1991-1995 war in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina
T2  - CROATIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Aim To explore the short- and long-term psychological consequences of rape on women victims of rape during the 1992-1995 war against Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
   Methods The study included 68 women victims of rape and was conducted at the Medical Center for Human Rights, Zagreb, Croatia, from 1992 to 1995. Testimony method and a questionnaire were used to retrospectively obtain the description of rapes and symptoms women suffered immediately after rape and at the time of the study, ie, 11.9 +/- 2.4 months after the trauma. Structured clinical interviews were conducted to diagnose psychiatric disorders that were present at the time of study, according to the third edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
   Results The raped women were Croatian and Muslim (Bosniak) women, residents of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Forty-four of them were raped more than once, 21 were raped every day during their captivity, and 18 were forced to witness rapes. Most of the rapes (n = 65) were accompanied by physical torture. The most frequent psychological symptoms felt immediately after the rape were depressiveness (n = 58), avoidance of thoughts or conversations associated with the trauma (n = 40), and suicidal ideas (n = 25). Although none of the women had a psychiatric history before the rape, at the time of study 52 suffered from depression, 5 1 from social phobia, 21 from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 17 had sexual dysfunctions. These disorders were often comorbid. Out of 29 women who got pregnant after rape, 17 had artificial abortion. The decision to have an abortion was strongly predicted by suicidal thoughts and impulses (odds ratio, 25.8; 9596 confidence interval, 2.53-263.2).
   Conclusion War-time rapes had deep immediate and long-term consequences on the mental health of women victims of rapes and their social and interpersonal functioning.

TI  - Terminations of pregnancy in the European Union
T2  - BJOG-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
AB  - Objective To study the current legislation and trends in terminations of pregnancy in the European Union (EU).
   Design Data were collected on legislation and statistics for terminations of pregnancy.
   Setting Population-based statistics from the EU member states.
   Population Women in reproductive age in the 27 EU member states.
   Methods Information on legislation was collected for all 27 EU member states. Statistical information until 2008 was compiled from international (n = 24) and national sources (n = 17). Statistical data were not available for Austria, Cyprus and Luxembourg.
   Main outcomes measures Terminations of pregnancy per 1000 women aged 15-49 years.
   Results Ireland, Malta and Poland have restrictive legislation. Luxembourg permits termination of pregnancy on physical and mental health indications; Cyprus, Finland, and the UK further include socio-economic indications. In all other EU member states termination of pregnancy can be performed in early pregnancy on a women's request. In general, the rates of termination of pregnancy have declined in recent years. In total, 10.3 terminations were reported per 1000 women aged 15-49 years in the EU in 2008. The rate was 12.3/1000 for countries requiring a legal indication for termination, and 11.0/1000 for countries allowing termination on request. Northern Europe (10.9/1000) and Central and Eastern Europe (10.8/1000) had higher rates than Southern Europe (8.9/1000). Northern Europe, however, had substantially higher rates of termination of pregnancy among teenagers.
   Conclusion A more consistent and coherent reporting of terminations of pregnancy is needed in the EU. The large variation of termination rates between countries suggests that termination of pregnancy rates may be reduced in some countries without restricting women's access to termination. Sexual education and provision of access to reliable and affordable contraception are essential to achieve low rates of termination of pregnancy.

TI  - The emotional responses of women when terminating a pregnancy for medical reasons: A scoping review
T2  - MIDWIFERY
AB  - Background: In most countries of the world the only basis for considering a termination of pregnancy is for medical reasons. Depending on the circumstances and determinants of each case, the emotional responses to this event vary greatly. The aim of this study is to map the emotional responses of women when their pregnancy is terminated for medical reasons. Methods: A scoping review was carried out. This covered all types of qualitative and quantitative studies published in English or Spanish since 2014 which included first-person accounts of women's emotional responses when they had a termination. A bibliographic search was made of four databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and Pubmed) along with an additional manual search and backward and forward citation chaining of the studies included. The data were reported in narrative form and the results grouped according to the descriptive characteristics of the study and the emotions involved. Findings: The review process resulted in the inclusion of thirty-four studies. nineteen of these followed a qualitative approach and fifteen used quantitative methodology, with six of them being intervention studies. The emotions found ranged from anxiety and depression to guilt and thankfulness, so various authors stressed the need to improve training for health professionals to provide information, advice and support to the women during the entire process of the termination of pregnancy for medical reasons. Conclusions: The available studies cannot be compared given the variety of designs. The predominant emotions underlying the termination for medical reasons were stress, anxiety and depression. Future research should be carried out using samples of participants covering all causes of termination for medical reasons in a particular context so that an intervention can be designed to help lessen the impact of the process on women's mental health.

TI  - Association Between Serious Psychological Distress and Loneliness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study with Pregnant Japanese Women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Purpose: Pregnant women are vulnerable to stress. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) has caused a global pandemic and created significant stress for many people. Social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 has also reduced social interactions, which has increased social isolation and loneliness. Loneliness is thought to increase perceived stress, cause psychological distress, and increase the risk of mental illness, such as depression. This study examined the association between serious psychological distress (SPD) and loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant Japanese women. Patients and Methods: An internet survey of 1022 pregnant women in Japan was conducted between June 1 and July 21, 2021. The 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, 3-item Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale were used as measurement tools. The prevalence of SPD was defined as a K6 score of >= 13. Results: The prevalence of SPD was 16.5%. Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for SPD were younger age (odds ratio [OR] 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.10; p = 0.020), history of abortion or miscarriages (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.36; p = 0.034), unemployment (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.45; p = 0.008), fear of COVID-19 (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.17; p < 0.001), and loneliness (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.38 to 1.70; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Pregnant women in Japan showed a high prevalence of SPD. Younger age, unemployment, history of abortion or miscarriages, fear of COVID-19, and loneliness were independently associated with SPD. Clinicians and health officials should pay particular attention to the psychological health of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Clinical factors associated with anxiety and depression in Korean women with abnormal uterine bleeding
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
AB  - The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression and to correlate symptoms of anxiety and depression with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in Korean women. Our study included 124 Korean premenopausal women aged 15-55 without treatment of psychiatric disorders, who visited one university hospital due to AUB between September 2015 and December 2019. The Korean Beck Anxiety Inventory (K-BAI) and the Korean Beck Depression-II (K-BDI-II) were used to assess Anxiety and depression symptoms. We also analyzed obstetrical and clinical data to assess the association between anxiety and depression with AUB. The cut-off scores for possible anxiety disorder were met by 37.9% (47 women) of the patients and for possible depression disorder by 19.5% (24 women). The most common menstrual associated symptoms were heavy menstrual bleeding (80.6%), dysmenorrhea (55.6%), and irregular menstrual cycles (33.9%). More women with AUB in our study had anxiety as measured by the K-BAI and depression as measured by the K-BDI-II than general Korean population. A history of abortion and cesarean section (C/sec) were related with anxiety, whereas a history of minor surgery was related to depression. Anxiety and depression (r = 0.629, P < 0.001) were correlated with AUB. According to age, variable factors affect anxiety (history of abortion, history of C/sec, minor surgery, Body mass index [BMI], history of OCs) and depression (BMI >= 25, history of minor surgery). We have found that anxiety and depression seem to be underestimated in Korean women with AUB symptoms. The relationship between the development of anxiety and depression with variable factors are unknown and therefore, further study is needed to clarify and understand the effects of AUB. To improve the health of women with AUB, screening for mental health issues is needed for early detection and treatment of anxiety and depression.

TI  - Activation of SGK1/ENaC Signaling Pathway Improves the Level of Decidualization in Unexplained Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is one of the most common complications during pregnancy and seriously affects women's physical and mental health. About 50% of RSA cases are of unknown etiology. Our previous study found that the decidual tissue of patients with unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) had low expression levels of serum and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase (SGK) 1. Endometrial decidualization is a key link in the early stage of pregnancy and is crucial to the development and maintenance of pregnancy. Decidualization is the proliferation and differentiation of endometrial stromal cells into deciduals, which involves a complex physiological process such as ovarian steroid hormones (estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, etc.), growth factors, and intercellular signaling. The binding of estrogen and its receptor stimulates the synthesis of endometrial deciduating markers prolactin (PRL) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), which mediates the occurrence of decidualization. Among them, SGK1/ENaC is a signaling pathway closely related to decidualization. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the expression of SGK1 and decidualization-related molecules in the decidual tissue of URSA patients and to explore the potential mechanism of SGK1's protective effect in URSA patients and in mouse models. Decidual tissue samples from 30 URSA patients and 30 women who actively terminated pregnancy were collected, and a URSA mouse model was established and treated with dydrogesterone. Expression levels of SGK1 and its signaling pathway-related proteins (p-Nedd4-2, 14-3-3 protein and ENaC-a), estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER beta, PR), and decidualization markers (PRLR, IGFBP-1) were assessed. Our study found that SGK1, p-Nedd4-2, 14-3-3 proteins, and ENaC-a expression levels were reduced in the decidual tissue, the SGK1/ENaC signaling pathway was inhibited, and the expression levels of the decidualization markers PRLR and IGFBP-1 were downregulated in the URSA group compared with the controls. Additionally, the concentrations of E-2, P, and PRL in the serum of mice were decreased in the URSA group compared with the controls. However, SGK1/ENaC pathway-related proteins, estrogen and progesterone and their receptors, and decidualization-related molecules were upregulated by dydrogesterone. These data suggest that estrogen and progesterone can induce decidualization by activating the SGK1/ENaC signaling pathway; disruption of this pathway can lead to the development of URSA. Dydrogesterone can increase the expression level of SGK1 protein in decidual tissue.

TI  - Biological, Behavioral and Physiological Consequences of Drug-Induced Pregnancy Termination at First-Trimester Human Equivalent in an Animal Model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Given the significant physiological changes that take place during and resulting from pregnancy, as well as the relative absence of such information in relation to pregnancy termination, this study investigated the potential for developing a valid animal model to objectively assess the biological, physiological and behavioral consequences of drug-induced pregnancy termination. Female Long-Evans rats were divided into four groups (n = 19-21/group), controlling for drug [mifepristone (50 mg/kg/3 ml, i.g.)/misoprostol (0.3 mg/kg/ml, i.g.) or vehicle (1% Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium/0.2% Tweene (R) 80 suspension, i.g.)] and pregnancy. Drug administration took place on days 12-14 of gestation (days 28-40 human gestational equivalent). Vehicle was administered to the controls on the same days. Parameters measured included rat body weight, food intake, vaginal impedance, sucrose consumption/preference, locomotor activity, forced swim test, and home-cage activity. At the termination of the study, rats were deeply anesthetized using urethane, and blood, brain, and liver were collected for biochemical analysis. Following drug/vehicle administration, only the pregnancy termination group (pregnant, drug) displayed a significant decrease in body weight, food intake, locomotor activity-related behaviors and home-cage activity relative to the control group (non-pregnant, vehicle). Additionally, the pregnancy termination group was the only group that displayed a significant reduction in sucrose consumption/preference during Treatment Week relative to Pre-Treatment Week. Vaginal impedance did not significantly decrease over time in parous rats in contrast to all other groups, including the rats in the pregnancy termination group. Biochemical analysis indicated putative drug- and pregnancy-specific influences on oxidative balance. Regression analysis indicated that pregnancy termination was a predictor variable for body weight, food intake and all locomotor activity parameters measured. Moreover, pertaining to body weight and food intake, the pregnancy termination group displayed significant changes, which were not present in a group of naturally miscarrying rats following pregnancy loss. Overall, our results appear to suggest negative biological and behavioral effects following pregnancy termination, that appear to also be distinct from natural miscarriage, and potential benefits of parity pertaining to fecundity. Thus, our findings indicate the importance for further objective investigation of the physiological and behavioral consequences of medical abortion, in order to provide further insight into the potential implications in humans.

TI  - Suicide Ideation and Acceptability Among Females Aged 15 to 34 Years in Rural China
T2  - JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
AB  - The suicide rate of females is very close to that of males in China, in contrast to Western societies, in which the rates of male suicide outnumber those of females by three to four times. This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal ideation and prosuicide attitude (acceptability) among females of childbearing age. With the Chinese version of the Scale for Suicide Ideation and the General Social Survey questionnaire, we examined the demographic and psychological risk factors of suicide among Chinese rural young females aged 15 to 34 years. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the factors related to suicidal ideation and suicide acceptability. The prevalence rates of suicidal ideation and suicide acceptability among the sampled females are 22.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Education, depression, social support, hopelessness, and negative life events were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. Ethnicity, education, abortion, and depression were significantly associated with suicide acceptability. There is statistical difference between suicide ideation and acceptability. The results indicate that mental disorder remains a major risk factor of suicidal ideation. Sociodemographic and psychological characteristics are associated with suicide acceptability.

TI  - Screening for post-miscarriage psychiatric morbidity
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) in screening for psychiatric morbidity after miscarriage.
   Study design: A prospective cohort study was carried out involving 222 patients. Six weeks after miscarriage, the GHQ-12 was applied. Psychiatric "case'' or "non-case'' was diagnosed by the psychiatrist with use of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-R. The patients were computer randomized into Groups A or B. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed for Group A. The optimal cutoff value of GHQ-12 was determined, and this value was applied to Group B. The test characteristics were assessed.
   Results: Twenty-seven patients were found to be psychiatric cases. An ROC with area under curve of 0.93 (95% CI 0.87-0.99, P < . 001) was constructed. The best GHQ-12 cutoff score was >= 4 in detecting psychiatric caseness. A sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 90%, positive predictive value of 50%, and negative predictive value of 98% were obtained.
   Conclusion: GHQ-12 is an effective screening tool in detecting psychiatric morbidity after miscarriage. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fundamentalist Demonstrations on the Liberal Arts Campus: Observations and Recommendations
T2  - JOURNAL OF COLLEGE STUDENT DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This article explores the impact on students when non university-affiliated conservative fundamentalist Christian groups conduct provocative demonstrations on campus. As university administrators work to balance free speech rights with missions of civility and pluralism, there is a need to assess and address potential adverse impacts of these sensational events. Based on a survey of 97 public university students after a controversial demonstration, we found the most adverse impact to be on students' emotions, followed by disruption to their routines, changes to their feelings of safety, and minor consequences on academic activities. Those closer in proximity to the demonstration reported more adverse effects, and there were small differences in effects as a function of student gender, sexual orientation, and Christian identity. Counter to the ostensibly conservative aims of the demonstration, students typically reported it had little affect on their attitudes or that the demonstration made them more in favor of abortion rights, more supportive of homosexuality, and more anti-Christian. In addition, the demonstration caused many to question free speech and First Amendment rights. Results are discussed with regard to minimizing negative effects on our campus communities through the intentional involvement of faculty, campus police, and mental health service providers.

TI  - Association Between State-Level Access to Reproductive Care and Suicide Rates Among Women of Reproductive Age in the United States
T2  - JAMA PSYCHIATRY
AB  - IMPORTANCE Many states in the United States enforce restrictions to reproductive care, with access to abortion remaining a highly divisive issue. Denial of abortion is linked with heightened stress and anxiety among reproductive-aged women. However, no studies have tested whether access to reproductive care is linked to suicide. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether state-level restrictions in access to reproductive care in the United States were associated with suicide rates among reproductive-aged women from 1974 to 2016. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A longitudinal ecologic study with a difference-in-differences analysis assessed whether annual changes in the enforcement of state-level restrictions to reproductive care were related to annual state-level suicide rates vs rates of death due to motor vehicle crashes. Duration of follow-up varied between different states (range, 4-40 years), contingent on the first year that restrictions were implemented. Models controlled for year and state fixed effects and other relevant demographic and economic factors. Analyses were conducted between December 2021 and January 2022. EXPOSURES Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (TRAP) laws index measuring state-year-level restrictions to reproductive care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual state-level suicide rates and motor vehicle crash death rates among reproductive-aged women (ages 20-34 years; target group) vs women of postreproductive age (ages 45-64 years; control group). RESULTS Twenty-one US states enforced at least 1 TRAP law between 1974 and 2016. Annual rates of death by suicide ranged from 1.4 to 25.6 per 100 000 women of reproductive age to 2.7 to 33.2 per 100 000 women of postreproductive age during the study period (1974-2016). Annual motor vehicle crash death rates among women of reproductive age ranged from 2.4 to 42.9 per 100 000. Enforcement of TRAP laws was associated with higher suicide rates among reproductive-aged women (beta = 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.32; P = .02) but not women of postreproductive age (beta = 0.06; 95% CI, -0.11 to 0.24; P = .47) nor to deaths due to motor vehicle crashes (beta = 0.03, 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.11; P = .36). Among reproductive-aged women, the weighted average annual-state level suicide death rate when no TRAP laws were enforced was 5.5 per 100 000. Enforcement of a TRAP law was associated with a 5.81% higher annual rate of suicide than in pre-enforcement years. Findings remained significant when using alternative, broader indices of reproductive care access and different age categorizations. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study with a difference-in-differences analysis of US women, restrictions on access to reproductive care from 1974 to 2016 were associated with suicide rates among reproductive-aged women. Given the limitations of the ecologic design of this study, further research is needed to assess whether current factors affecting access to reproductive care services are related to suicide risk among women of reproductive age and to inform suicide prevention strategies.

TI  - Maternal Parenting Stress in the Face of Early Regulatory Disorders in Infancy: A Machine Learning Approach to Identify What Matters Most
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Objective: Early regulatory disorders (ERD) in infancy are typically associated with high parenting stress (PS). Theoretical and empirical literature suggests a wide range of factors that may contribute to PS related to ERD. The aim of this study was to identify key predictors ofmaternal PS within a large predictor data set in a sample of N = 135 mothers of infants diagnosed with ERD.
   Methods: We used machine learning to identify relevant predictors. Maternal PS was assessed with the Parenting Stress Index. The multivariate dataset assessed cross-sectionally consisted of 464 self-reported and clinically rated variables covering mother-reported psychological distress, maternal self-efficacy, parental reflective functioning, socio-demographics, each parent's history of illness, recent significant life events, former miscarriage/abortion, pregnancy, obstetric history, infants' medical history, development, and social environment. Variables were drawn from behavioral diaries on regulatory symptoms and parental co-regulative behavior as well as a clinical interview which was utilized to diagnose ERD and to assess clinically rated regulatory symptoms, quality of parent-infant relationship, organic/biological and psychosocial risks, and social-emotional functioning.
   Results: The final prediction model identified 11 important variables summing up to the areas maternal self-efficacy, psychological distress (particularly depression and anger-hostility), infant regulatory symptoms (particularly duration of fussing/crying), and age-appropriate physical development. The RMSE (i.e., prediction accuracy) of the final model applied to the test set was 21.72 (R-2 = 0.58).
   Conclusions: This study suggests that among behavioral, environmental, developmental, parent-infant relationship, and mental health variables, a mother's higher self-efficacy, psychological distress symptoms particularly depression and anger symptoms, symptoms in the child particularly fussing/crying symptoms, and age-inappropriate physical development are associated with higher maternal PS. With these factors identified, clinicians may more efficiently assess a mother's PS related to ERD in a low-risk help-seeking sample.

TI  - Psychiatric vulnerability and the risk for unintended pregnancies, a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB  - Background Unintended pregnancies (UPs) are a global health problem as they contribute to adverse maternal and offspring outcomes, which underscores the need for prevention. As psychiatric vulnerability has previously been linked to sexual risk behavior, planning capacities and compliance with contraception methods, we aim to explore whether it is a risk factor for UPs. Methods Electronic databases were searched in November 2020. All articles in English language with data on women with age >= 18 with a psychiatric diagnosis at time of conception and reported pregnancy intention were included, irrespective of obstetric outcome (fetal loss, livebirth, or abortion). Studies on women with intellectual disabilities were excluded. We used the National Institutes of Health tool for assessment of bias in individual studies and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method for assessment of quality of the primary outcome. Findings Eleven studies reporting on psychiatric vulnerability and UPs were included. The participants of these studies were diagnosed with mood, anxiety, psychotic, substance use, conduct and eating disorders. The studies that have been conducted show that women with a psychiatric vulnerability (n = 2650) have an overall higher risk of UPs compared to women without a psychiatric vulnerability (n = 16,031) (OR 1.34, CI 1.08-1.67) and an overall weighed prevalence of UPs of 65% (CI 0.43-0.82) (n = 3881). Interpretation Studies conducted on psychiatric vulnerability and UPs are sparse and many (common) psychiatric vulnerabilities have not yet been studied in relation to UPs. The quality of the included studies was rated fair to poor due to difficulties with measuring the outcome pregnancy intention (use of various methods of assessment and use of retrospective study designs with risk of bias) and absence of a control group in most of the studies. The findings suggest an increased risk of UPs in women with psychiatric vulnerability. As UPs have important consequences for mother and child, discussing family planning in women with psychiatric vulnerabilities is of utmost importance.

TI  - Multifactor Analysis and Intervention Study on Menstrual Disorders of Female Athletes in the Context of the Winter Olympic Games: A Case-Control Study Based on a Large Sample
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - A case-control study was conducted to explore the multifactor analysis and intervention of menstrual disorders in female athletes under the background of the Winter Olympic Games, which is based on a large sample. For this purpose, from January 2020 to September 2021, 381 female athletes in long-term ice and snow sports were investigated by random sampling. All of them promoted gynecological examination and counted the incidence of menstrual disorders. The subjects were assigned into two groups according to their menstrual status: abnormal (n = 163) and normal menstrual state groups (n = 218). The basic and clinical data of the two groups were compared, and univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were employed to explore the risk factors of menstrual disorders in female athletes. According to the random number table method, the menstrual disorder group was again assigned into the intervention group and the control group. The intervention group received health education and glucose supplement intervention to correct EAMDs, while the control group only received health education. The improvement of patients' ability balance and the changes of reproductive hormones were compared after intervention. The results of univariate analysis indicated that there exhibited no significant differences in age, menarche age, smoking history, drinking history, grade, sexual life history, abortion history, BMI, and location of household registration, but there were significant differences in family history, sleep quality, diet regularity, and mental health status (P < 0.05). The results of univariate analysis indicated that there exhibited no significant differences in age, menarche, smoking, drinking, grade, sexual life history, abortion history, family history, sleep quality, diet regularity, and mental health status. Logistic regression analysis indicated that family history of menstrual disorders, poor sleep quality, irregular diet, and mental health status all affected women's menstrual disorders (OR: 1.411, 95% CI: 1.378-1.444; OR: 1.501, 95% CI: 1.030-2.187; OR: 1.554, 95% CI: 1.086-2.225; OR: 1.383, 95% CI: 1.018-1.877, respectively) independent risk factors. According to the comparison of menstrual cycle, in the intervention group, 12 patients had menstrual cycle 21-28 days, 12 patients had menstrual cycle 28-38 days, and 58 patients were irregular and had no amenorrhea, while in the control group, 36 patients had menstrual cycle 21-28 days, 24 patients had 28-38 days, 12 patients had amenorrhea, and 11 patients had irregular menstruation, and there exhibited no significant difference (P > 0.05). There exhibited no significant difference in energy balance before and after intervention (P > 0.05); after intervention, the ability balance of the two groups was significantly promoted, and the degree of improvement in the study group was better (P < 0.05). The indexes of reproductive hormones in the follicular phase were compared before and after glucose supplement intervention, and there exhibited no significant difference before intervention (P > 0.05); after intervention, the serum LH and GnRH of the two groups decreased, while FSH and P increased. The improvement degree of the intervention group was better than that of the control group, but there exhibited no significant difference (P > 0.05). Before intervention, there exhibited no significant difference in the serum E2 level in the follicular phase (P > 0.
   05); after the intervention, the serum E2 of the two groups increased significantly, and the improvement of the intervention group was better (P < 0.05). Before intervention, there exhibited no significant difference in the serum E2 level in the follicular phase (P > 0.05); after the intervention, the serum E2 of the two groups increased significantly, and the im-provement of the intervention group was better (P < 0.05). Before intervention, there exhibited no significant difference in serum E2 and P levels in the luteal phase (P > 0.05); after intervention, the level of serum E2 decreased and the level of serum P increased in the two groups. There exhibited no significant difference in the level of serum E2 (P > 0.05). There exhibited significant difference in the serum P level (P < 0.05). Female athletes have a high rate of menstrual disorders. Family history of menstrualdisorders, poor sleep quality, irregular diet, and poor mental health are the main risk factors of menstrual disorders. Healtheducation and sugar supplement intervention measures for female athletes play a positive role in the improvement of their abilitybalance and the regulation of reproductive hormones,

TI  - 'My biggest fear is that people will forget about him': Mothers' emotional transitions after terminating their pregnancy for medical reasons
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
AB  - Aims and objectives To explore women's emotional responses throughout the process of terminating a pregnancy for medical reasons. Background Making the choice to terminate a desired pregnancy for medical reasons has a negative impact on women's health, as it is a distressing process that involves making hard decisions and readjusting one's expectations of an idealised pregnancy. Methods A qualitative phenomenological study was conducted following the COREQ checklist. Fifteen semi-structured interviews and two focus groups were conducted with women who had terminated their pregnancies for medical reasons, previous to and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Subsequently, we analysed the content. Results One main category, emotional journey during the process of terminating the pregnancy, and six subcategories were identified: (I) representation and desire to become a mother, (II) main concerns, (III) impact of the news, (IV) decision-making, (V) emotional responses before termination for medical reasons and (VI) emotional responses after termination for medical reasons. All contributed to understanding the specificities of the different phases that make up the emotional journey of terminating a pregnancy for medical reasons. Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that there are a number of predominant emotions that professionals need to be aware of in order to help women work through them and lessen the impact of pregnancy termination on their mental health. COVID-19 had different connotations depending on the women's experiences. Relevance to clinical practice Our results highlight how important the role of healthcare staff is in caring for these women and their partners, which involves recognising their emotions throughout the process. Our results also underline how useful it is to conduct qualitative studies in this context, since they constitute a set of activities and interventions that result in the administration of nursing care in itself. Patient or Public Contribution The ultimate goal of the action research study is to design a positive mental health intervention. Participants will contribute to the design and final approval of the intervention.

TI  - Understanding psychological distress among mothers in rural Nepal: a qualitative grounded theory exploration
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: There is a large burden of psychological distress in low and middle-income countries, and culturally relevant interventions must be developed to address it. This requires an understanding of how distress is experienced. We conducted a qualitative grounded theory study to understand how mothers experience and manage distress in Dhanusha, a low-resource setting in rural Nepal. We also explored how distressed mothers interact with their families and the wider community.
   Methods: Participants were identified during a cluster-randomised controlled trial in which mothers were screened for psychological distress using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with distressed mothers (GHQ-12 score >= 5) and one with a traditional healer (dhami), as well as 12 focus group discussions with community members. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods and a model was developed to explain psychological distress in this setting.
   Results: We found that distress was termed tension by participants and mainly described in terms of physical symptoms. Key perceived causes of distress were poor health, lack of sons, and fertility problems. Tension developed in a context of limited autonomy for women and perceived duty towards the family. Distressed mothers discussed several strategies to alleviate tension, including seeking treatment for perceived physical health problems and tension from doctors or dhamis, having repeated pregnancies until a son was delivered, manipulating social circumstances in the household, and deciding to accept their fate. Their ability to implement these strategies depended on whether they were able to negotiate with their in-laws or husbands for resources.
   Conclusions: Vulnerability, as a consequence of gender and social disadvantage, manifests as psychological distress among mothers in Dhanusha. Screening tools incorporating physical symptoms of tension should be envisaged, along with interventions to address gender inequity, support marital relationships, and improve access to perinatal healthcare.

TI  - Maternal psychological distress and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care at public hospitals, Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - ObjectiveMothers who have endured psychological distress during pregnancy are more likely to have cognitive and behavioral issues for their baby, and are at greater risk for subsequent mental health problems for themselves. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of psychological distress during pregnancy in women attending antenatal clinics in Addis Ababa public hospitals and to find out if there are any associated factors. MethodsHospital based cross sectional study was employed from May 7 to June 6, 2019 at public hospitals. A total of 810 pregnant women participated in the study selected through systematic random sampling technique. Kessler psychological distress Scale (K10) was used to measure psychological distress during pregnancy. Frequency tables and graphs were used to describe the study variable. The association between variables analyzed with bi-variable and multivariable binary logistic regression. A statistical significance was declared at p value < 0.05 with 95% confidence interval. ResultA total of 810 participants were included in the study with the response rate of 92%. The Prevalence of psychological distress among pregnant women was found to be 174(21.5%) with (95% CI, 18.6, 24.6). decreasing age [AOR = 3.61, 95%CI, 1.00, 13.01], no formal education [AOR = 3.57, 95%CI, 2.06, 6.19], having an abortion history [AOR = 2.23, 95%CI, 1.29, 3.87], having intimate partner violence [AOR = 4.06, 95%CI, 2.37, 6.94] and poor social support[AOR = 3.33, 95%CI, 1.95, 5.70] were statistically associated with psychological distress during pregnancy. ConclusionThis research found high prevalence of psychological distress during pregnancy compared with majorities of preceding studies. In this study we identified factors that are associated with psychological distress in pregnancy. This includes, decreasing age, no formal education, having an abortion history, having intimate partner violence and poor social support. Psychological distress screening and potential risk factors for mental illness evaluations should be carried out during pregnancy for early diagnosis and intervention.

TI  - Suicidal ideation and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Jimma medical center, Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background Suicidal ideation (SI) among pregnant women is a major public health concern worldwide and is associated with a higher risk of completed suicide. However, there are limited studies that determined the prevalence and the potential determinants of suicidal ideation in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the prevalence of suicidal ideation and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Jimma, Ethiopia. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 pregnant women attending Jimma medical center in Southwest, Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Suicidal ideation assessed using the Suicidality Module of the World Mental Health survey initiative version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Other tools used are EPDS, Abuse Assessment Scale (AAS), DASS -21, PSS, Maternity Social Support Scale (MSSS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to explore the potential determinants of suicidal ideation among the participants. Result The prevalence of SI among women who are on antenatal care was found to be 13.3% (95% CI (10.1,16.4). In multivariable analysis, marital status with lack of cohabiting partners (AOR = 2.80,95%CI:1.23,6.37), history of abortion (AOR = 2.45,95% CI:1.03,5.93), having depression (AOR = 4.28,95% CI:1.75,10.44),anxiety(AOR = 2.99,95% CI:1.24,7.20), poor sleep quality (AOR = 2.85,95% CI:1.19,6.79), stress (AOR = 2.50, 95% CI:1.01,5.67), and intimate partner violence (AOR = 2.43, 95% CI:1.07,5.47) were found to be significant predictors of suicidal ideation. Conclusion The prevalence of SI among pregnant women was found to be huge. Lack of cohabiting partners, previous history of abortion, depression, anxiety, intimate partner violence, poor sleep quality, and stress were variables that are independent predictors of suicidal ideation. Screening and interventions of antenatal SI are needed.

TI  - Maternal anxiety and its interference in breastfeeding self-efficacy
T2  - ACTA PAULISTA DE ENFERMAGEM
AB  - Objective: To analyze the relationship of maternal anxiety symptoms with breastfeeding self-efficacy and duration of exclusive breastfeeding.Methods: Prospective cohort study developed in a Breastfeeding Center of a university hospital in the city of Sao Paulo. The sample consisted of 83 postpartum women in follow-up for 210 days after delivery. The Anxiety Subscale of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale were used.Results: The mean total score for anxiety was 3.76 points and for maternal self-efficacy to breastfeed was 128.58. Over the months, anxiety symptoms and breastfeeding self-efficacy showed similar behavior and were not statistically significant. The following risk factors were associated with the increase in anxiety symptoms: abortion, previous history of depression, complaints about oneself, unsatisfactory family and marital relationships, worsening of the relationship with the partner after the baby was born and lower maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy, reflected in the technique domain and intrapersonal thoughts domain. The time between cessation of exclusive breastfeeding and anxiety was not statistically different.Conclusion: The investigated postpartum women had a high prevalence of anxiety symptoms, with significant interference in the perception and confidence in their ability and maternal capability to successfully breastfeed the baby. There was no association between anxiety symptoms and early breastfeeding cessation.

TI  - Happiness in Old Age: The Daughter Connection
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES
AB  - Family and intergenerational relationships are becoming increasingly important as sources of support and care for the elderly population in rapidly ageing Asian societies. However, this has also raised concerns over reinforcement of cultural preference for sons as a source of old-age security. This paper therefore revisits the question-what determines happiness in old age-by investigating the role of adult children's gender in the context of Thailand, an ageing Asian country with no legacy of sex-preference in fertility. We employ nationally representative data to examine the association between old-age happiness and presence of a co-residing child. Compared to living alone, living with at least one child is found to positively associate with older persons' happiness. However, this result is specific to daughters. Moreover, compared to older men, women systematically benefit from a "daughter effect". Co-residing daughters with university education and those who maintain a good relationship with their parents help explain the positive happiness effect on older persons. Co-residing daughters are also positively linked to reduced loneliness; improved self-rated health; and improved economic conditions of older parents. Our findings suggest that policies that increase human capital of the girl child and enhance family solidarity are likely to have long term intergenerational wellbeing benefits.

TI  - Psychological morbidity following miscarriage
T2  - BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH CLINICAL OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY
AB  - Emerging evidence has suggested that miscarriage could be associated with significant and possibly enduring psychological consequences, As many as 50% of miscarrying women suffer some form of psychological morbidity in the weeks and months after loss. About 40% of miscarrying women were found to be suffering from symptoms of grief shortly after miscarriage, and pathological grief can follow. Elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms are common, and major depressive disorder has been reported in 10-50% after miscarriage. Psychological symptoms could persist for 6 months to 1 year after miscarriage. The underlying risk factors predisposing a miscarrying woman to psychological morbidity include a history of psychiatric illness, childlessness, lack of social support or poor marital adjustment, prior pregnancy loss, and ambivalence toward the fetus. In addition, care-givers should be aware of the possible moderating effect of clinical practices such as surgical treatment and ultrasound findings on the psychological impact on a miscarrying woman. Unlike in postpartum depression, simple and effective screening measures of psychological morbidity in the context of miscarriage have not been well established. While studies have highlighted that psychological follow-up was highly desired by miscarrying women, and that psychological intervention was potentially beneficial, there is a substantial lack of randomized controlled intervention studies in this area.

TI  - Stability and change in adult attachment styles: Associations with personal vulnerabilities, life events, and global construals of self and others
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The current study examined the predictors of stability and change in adult attachment styles in a community sample (N = 442) of women who underwent an abortion. Across a two-year time period, 46% of our participants changed their attachment style, suggesting that these styles may be relatively flexible. Among those women who changed their attachment style, stable vulnerability factors (a history of depression and/or abuse) were related to increases in insecurity over time, whereas changes in global construals of self and others (e.g., increases in self-esteem and perceptions of social support) were related to increases in security over time. Relationship-related life events (e.g., divorce, the death of someone close) were not strongly related to attachment style stability or change. Finally, changes in attachment style across time were accompanied by corresponding changes in overall mental health. These findings suggest that although attachment styles are moderately stable over time, meaningful change in these styles can be linked to a change in understanding of personal and interpersonal experiences, and to dispositional risk factors. Results also highlight the importance of differentiating the factors that predict increased security over time from those that predict increased insecurity over time.

TI  - A Cure for Crime? Psycho-Pharmaceuticals and Crime Trends
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - In this paper we consider possible links between the diffusion of new pharmaceuticals used for treating mental illness and crime rates. We describe recent trends in crime and review the evidence showing that mental illness is a clear risk factor both for criminal behavior and victimization. We summarize the development of a number of new pharmaceutical therapies for the treatment of mental illness that can le into wide use during the "great American crime decline." We examine limited international data, as well as more detailed American data, to assess the relationship between rates of prescriptions of psychotropic drugs and crime rates, while controlling for other factors that may explain trends in crime rates. Using state-level variation in the rates that various drug therapies disperse within populations to identify impacts on crime rates, we find some evidence that the expansion of psychiatric drugs is associated with decreased violent crime rates, but not property crime rates. We find no robust impacts on homicide rates and no effects on arrest rates. Further, the magnitudes of the estimated effects of expanded drug treatment on violent-crime are small. Our estimates imply that about 5 percent of the decline in crime during the period of our study was due to expanded mental health treatment.

TI  - Infertility treatment and marital relationships: a 1-year prospective study among successfully treated ART couples and their controls
T2  - HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB  - Evidence about the effects of infertility and assisted reproduction technique (ART) on marital relationships is discrepant. Here, we examined the impact of ART on marital relationships. The roles of life stressors, infertility and treatment characteristics in predicting marital relations were also evaluated. METHODS: Subjects: 367 couples with singleton IVF/ICSI pregnancies. Controls: 379 couples with spontaneous singleton pregnancies. Women and men were assessed when the child was 2 months (T2) and 12 months old (T3). They further reported stressful life events at T2 and depression in pregnancy. RESULTS: No between-group differences were found in marital satisfaction and dyadic cohesion. Dyadic consensus deteriorated from T2 to T3 only among control women. Sexual affection was low among control men at T2 and stressful life events decreased it further. Depression during pregnancy predicted deteriorated marital relations only in control couples. Several unsuccessful treatment attempts were associated with good dyadic consensus and cohesion among ART women. Spontaneous abortions and multiple parity predicted poor marital satisfaction in ART women, whereas long duration of infertility and multiple parity predicted poor marital relations in ART men. CONCLUSIONS: Successful ART does not constitute a risk for marital adjustment. The shared stress of infertility may even stabilize marital relationships.

TI  - Women's experiences in relation to stillbirth and risk factors for long-term post-traumatic stress symptoms: a retrospective study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives (1) To investigate the experiences of women with a previous stillbirth and their appraisal of the care they received at the hospital. (2) To assess the long-term level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in this group and identify risk factors for this outcome.
   Design A retrospective study.
   Setting Two university hospitals.
   Participants The study population comprised 379 women with a verified diagnosis of stillbirth (23 gestational weeks or birth weight 500g) in a singleton or twin pregnancy 5-18years previously. 101 women completed a comprehensive questionnaire in two parts.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures The women's experiences and appraisal of the care provided by healthcare professionals before, during and after stillbirth. PTSS at follow-up was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale (IES).
   Results The great majority saw (98%) and held (82%) their baby. Most women felt that healthcare professionals were supportive during the delivery (85.6%) and showed respect towards their baby (94.9%). The majority (91.1%) had received some form of short-term follow-up. One-third showed clinically significant long-term PTSS (IES20). Independent risk factors were younger age (OR 6.60, 95% CI 1.99 to 21.83), induced abortion prior to stillbirth (OR 5.78, 95% CI 1.56 to 21.38) and higher parity (OR 3.46, 95% CI 1.19 to 10.07) at the time of stillbirth. Having held the baby (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.56) was associated with less PTSS.
   Conclusions The great majority saw and held their baby and were satisfied with the support from healthcare professionals. One in three women presented with a clinically significant level of PTSS 5-18years after stillbirth. Having held the baby was protective, whereas prior induced abortion was a risk factor for a high level of PTSS.
   Trial registration The study was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, with registration number NCT 00856076.

TI  - Work-related reproductive, musculoskeletal and mental disorders among working women - History, current issues and future research directions
T2  - INDUSTRIAL HEALTH
AB  - According to the recent changes of working environments and socio-economical conditions, the proportion of working women are increasing in Japan. Characteristics of occupational workload and stress of Japanese working women are consistent with those in many industrialized countries except man-dominant culture. In this review we describe the history, current issues, and future research directions on occupational health of working women, especially focused on reproductive health, work-related musculo-skeletal disorders (WMSDs), and mental disorders. In the reproductive health survey, traditionally main concern was about pregnancy outcomes, then fecundity studies, such as time to pregnancy, became topics recently. Future research will be shifted to outcomes not only during pregnancy but also disorders of hormonal balance and climacterium or health conditions after menopause. WMSDs are reviewed on mainly gender difference and its causative factors. Historically, mental health of working women in Japan has focused on the job stress of nurses. We compare results with a lot of recent researches in Europe and U.S.A., where interaction between occupational stress and family roles were studied. It is not easy to predict the prospective status of female workers in Japan, but social, workplace and familial supports will enhance their health promotion.

TI  - Identifying and Analyzing Health-Related Themes in Disinformation Shared by Conservative and Liberal Russian Trolls on Twitter
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - To combat health disinformation shared online, there is a need to identify and characterize the prevalence of topics shared by trolls managed by individuals to promote discord. The current literature is limited to a few health topics and dominated by vaccination. The goal of this study is to identify and analyze the breadth of health topics discussed by left (liberal) and right (conservative) Russian trolls on Twitter. We introduce an automated framework based on mixed methods including both computational and qualitative techniques. Results suggest that Russian trolls discussed 48 health-related topics, ranging from diet to abortion. Out of the 48 topics, there was a significant difference (p-value <= 0.004) between left and right trolls based on 17 topics. Hillary Clinton's health during the 2016 election was the most popular topic for right trolls, who discussed this topic significantly more than left trolls. Mental health was the most popular topic for left trolls, who discussed this topic significantly more than right trolls. This study shows that health disinformation is a global public health threat on social media for a considerable number of health topics. This study can be beneficial for researchers who are interested in political disinformation and health monitoring, communication, and promotion on social media by showing health information shared by Russian trolls.

TI  - Understanding Adoption as a Reproductive Justice Issue
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY
AB  - Adoption is frequently invoked as a universal social good-an uncomplicated win for adoptees, adoptive parents, and birth parents alike-that obviates the need for abortion. As antiabortionists weaponize adoption to attack reproductive rights, psychologists must recognize adoption as a key reproductive justice issue with significant, lifelong physical and psychological impacts, especially on adopted people and birth parents. Recognizing critical adoption studies as an application of a reproductive justice framework, we argue that psychologists must understand how adoption is both sustained by and reinforces structural inequality and global reproductive injustice. In a post-Roe reality, clinicians and researchers must critically examine adoption histories and myths in order to address the needs of the adoption triad. As an interdisciplinary team of researchers and clinicians in psychology; medicine; genetic counseling; and women's, gender, sexuality, and Asian American studies, we examine adoption's ties to settler colonialism, racism, classism, and imperialism and interrogate harmful dominant narratives about adoption. We then summarize clinical considerations for working with members of the adoption triad, future directions for research on adoption, and recommendations for both clinicians and researchers to advance adoption competence in the face of current attacks on reproductive rights in the United States.

TI  - HOW DID IT WORK - AN EXAMINATION OF THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH AN INTERVENTION FOR THE UNEMPLOYED PROMOTED JOB-SEARCH BEHAVIOR
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Conducted process analysis of treatment mediation effects (Judd & Kenney, 1981) on longitudinal data from a large randomized field experiment with 928 recently unemployed persons. The experimental treatment included an intervention that succeeded in promoting quality reemployment outcomes, as described in earlier reports (Caplan et al., 1989; Vinokur et al., 1991). Using Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1988), the analyses examined the mediating effects of job-search self-efficacy, attitude, norms, and intention on job-search behavior. The results provided substantial support for the theory of planned behavior and demonstrated the mediational role of job-search self-efficacy. For both 1- and 4-month posttests, job-search self-efficacy was shown to mediate the effects of the intervention through its direct effects on job-search intention and on short term job-search behavior, as well as through its indirect effects on subjective norms and attitude. However, in the longer term 4-month posttest, exposure to the intervention had a direct effect on job-search behavior. This long-term direct effect of the intervention was hypothesized to reflect the influence of inoculation against setbacks which is essential for sustaining the long-term behavioral efforts involved in job seeking.

TI  - Attitudes of the German public to restrictions on persons with mental illness in 1993 and 2011
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRIC SCIENCES
AB  - Aims. In recent years, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Mental Health Declaration for Europe and other initiatives laid the ground for improving the rights of persons with mental illness. This study aims to explore to what extent these achievements are reflected in changes of public attitudes towards restrictions on mentally ill people.
   Methods. Data from two population surveys that have been conducted in the 'new' States of Germany in 1993 and 2011 are compared with each other.
   Results. The proportion of respondents accepting compulsory admission of mentally ill persons to a psychiatric hospital remained unchanged in general, but the proportion opposing compulsory admission on grounds not sanctioned by law declined. In contrast, more respondents were opposed to permanently revoking the driver's license and fewer supported abortion and (voluntary) sterilisation in 2011. Concerning the right to vote and compulsory sterilisation, the proportion of those who did not give their views increased most.
   Conclusions. Two divergent trends in public attitudes towards restrictions on people with mental disorders emerge: While, in general, people's views on patients' rights have become more liberal, the public is also more inclined to restricting patients' freedom in case of deviant behaviour.

TI  - Unexpected pregnancy, experience of sexual violence and contraception among women who use cannabis or other illegal substance in the Great Paris Region: Data from the 2016 Health Barometer
T2  - REVUE D EPIDEMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
AB  - Background. - Women who use psychoactive substances could have higher levels of unplanned pregnancy and of difficulties accessing long-term contraceptive methods than those who do not use these substances. General population data on this topic are rare, particularly in France.
   Methods. - This study is based on data from the French Health Survey 2016, collected from women aged 15 to 49 years and living in the Great Paris region (N = 1626). Use of illegal psychoactive substances (cannabis, substances used via intranasal or intravenous administration) were evaluated over the lifecourse and, for cannabis, over the 12 months preceding the study. Unplanned pregnancies were ascertained over the preceding 5 years, emergency contraception, abortion, and the experience of sexual violence during the lifecourse. We also studied the number of sexual partners in the preceding 12 months, as well as current contraception. Data were analyzed using weighted logistic regression models, adjusted for participants' sociodemographic characteristics and tobacco use.
   Results. - Women who use illegal substances have a higher probability than non-users to experience an unplanned pregnancy in the preceding 5 years (OR associated with lifecourse cannabis use: 1.61, 95% CI 1.00-2.58), to have used emergency contraception (ORs between 2.20 to 2.90), to have had an abortion (OR associated with lifecourse cannabis use: 1.77, 95% CI 1.26-2.49), and to have experienced sexual violence (ORs between 1.87 to 3.14). They also had more sexual partners than non-users, but did not differ in terms of contraception.
   Conclusion. - In the general population, there is a relationship between women's use of illegal substances and their probability of experiencing sexual violence. These results should be brought to the attention of health professionals in contact with women, to help identify those who have addictive behaviors and identify their sexual and reproductive health needs.

T2  - JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE AND INFANT PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Aim To explore associations between manifest anxiety (Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale, TMAS), major obstetric and demographic features and maternal-fetal attachment (MFA) (Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale, MAAS) in women with previous miscarriages. Subjects and methods One hundred pregnant women with previous miscarriages, having uncomplicated singleton pregnancy, not receiving any medications, and conceived in a natural manner . Ages ranged between 19 and 47 years, gestational age between 4 and 35 weeks. Hierarchical multiple linear regression, Kruskal-Wallis test, and ANCOVA were used in data analysis. Results Maternal age, gestational age, previous abortions, parity, maternal education, and marital status in combination contributed significantly to the regression model in prediction of the MAAS quality and intensity scores. Adding the TMAS score accounted for an additional 17% of variation in the MAAS quality score, and the change in R-2 was significant. There was a negative relationship between the TMAS and the MAAS quality scores. The TMAS score did not contribute to prediction of the MAAS intensity. The highest TMAS values were in the women having anxious, ambivalent or affectless preoccupation. Conclusion Prevention of negative consequences of poor quality of MFA in women with previous miscarriages should include early screening for manifest anxiety.

TI  - Cognitive appraisal of health and its influencing factors among pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus: A cross-sectional study
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Aim: To investigate the status quo of cognitive appraisal of health and its influencing factors among pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus.Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from June 2020 to November 2020. Participants were recruited from a tertiary hospital by a convenient sample method. A total of 300 pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus completed the survey, including self-compiled individual information questionnaire, Cognitive Appraisal of Health Scale, Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale and General Self-Efficacy Scale.Results: For cognitive appraisal of health, the median score of challenge dimension was 3.75 (3.50, 4.00), benign/irrelevant was 2.75 (2.00, 3.50), harm/loss was 2.38 (2.00, 3.00) and threat was 2.40 (2.00, 2.80), respectively. Regression analyses showed that gestational age, mode of conception, history of abortion, insulin usage, pregnancy stress and self-efficacy were the predictors of cognitive appraisal of health. Conclusions: This study revealed that pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus tended to make positive cognitive appraisal of health. And healthcare providers need to make full use of their predictors of cognitive appraisal of health to improve cognitive appraisal to manage stress and ameliorate pregnancy outcomes.

TI  - Predictors of anxiety symptoms in the gynecological outpatient setting: The Thai experience
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Objective. To examine the prevalence and predictors of anxiety in women attending a gynecological outpatient service. Method. A total of 271 women who came to a gynecological outpatient clinic at a large university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, were asked to complete the state sub-scale of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and a questionnaire to obtain demographic, medical and gynecological information as well as a questionnaire to assess social support. A cutoff score of 46 on the STAI was considered to indicate the presence of moderate-severe anxiety. Result. One hundred (36.9%) subjects met criteria for anxiety. Anxious women were more likely to be young and to have had an abortion at an earlier age. They were more likely to reside in rural Thailand, report perception of low social support, present with abnormal vaginal discharge and to have a greater number of gynecological symptoms than non-anxious women. Additionally, anxious women were less likely to have knowledge about their diagnosis compared to non-anxious women. Conclusion. Clinically meaningful levels of anxiety are common among women attending an outpatient gynecological clinic. Awareness of risk factors for anxiety in these women will aid medical personnel in identifying those in need of additional support and/or mental health services.

TI  - Clustering of characteristics associated with unplanned pregnancies: the generation R study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Unplanned or unintended pregnancies form a major public health concern because they are associated with unfavorable birth outcomes as well as social adversity, stress and depression among parents-to-be. Several risk factors for unplanned pregnancies in women have previously been identified, but studies usually take a unidimensional approach by focusing on only one or few factors, disregarding the possibility that predictors might cluster. Furthermore, data on predictors in men are largely overlooked. The purpose of this study is to determine predictors of unplanned versus planned pregnancy, to determine predictors of ambivalent feelings regarding pregnancy, and to investigate how characteristics of men and women with an unplanned pregnancy cluster together. Methods This study was embedded in Generation R, a multiethnic population-based prospective cohort from fetal life onwards. Pregnancy intention was reported by 7702 women and 5367 partners. Information on demographic, mental, physical, social, and sexual characteristics was obtained. Logistic regression, multinomial regression and cluster analyses were performed to determine characteristics that were associated with an unplanned pregnancy, with ambivalent feelings regarding the unplanned pregnancy and the co-occurrence of characteristics in women and men with unplanned pregnancy. Results Twenty nine percent of the pregnancies were unplanned. Logistic regression analyses showed that 42 of 44 studied predictors were significantly associated with unplanned pregnancy. The most important predictors were young age, migration background, lower educational level, lower household income, financial difficulties, being single, lower cognitive ability, drug use prior to pregnancy, having multiple sexual partners in the year prior to the pregnancy, younger age of first sexual contact and a history of abortion. Multinomial regression analyses showed that a Turkish or Moroccan background, Islamic religion, little financial opportunities, being married, having >= 3 children, high educational level, more mental health and social problems and older age of first sexual contact were associated with prolonged ambivalent feelings regarding pregnancy. Different combinations of characteristics were observed in the four clusters of women and men with unplanned pregnancy. Conclusions Many predictors are related with unplanned pregnancies, ambivalent feelings toward the pregnancy, and we identified very heterogeneous groups of women and men with unplanned pregnancies. This calls for heterogeneous measures to prevent unplanned pregnancies.

TI  - Orphaned and abused youth are vulnerable to pregnancy and suicide risk
T2  - CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
AB  - Objective: Little is known about the magnitude and consequences of violence against children for those living outside family care. We sought to estimate the frequency of childhood abuse and examine its association with lifetime pregnancy involvement (LPI) and past year suicide ideation among orphaned youth.
   Methods: We analyzed data collected via cross-sectional interviewer-administered surveys completed by 293 orphaned youth aged 16-23 years living outside of family care in St. Petersburg, Russia. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of LPI and past year suicide ideation associated with childhood physical and sexual abuse. Other risk factors were also examined (e.g., social vulnerability, sexual and substance use behaviors), and characteristics of orphaned youth with LPI and past year suicide ideation were described.
   Results: The prevalence of childhood abuse was higher among females than among males (23.3% versus 15.6% for physical abuse, and 20.3% versus 5.6% for sexual abuse), as was the prevalence of LPI and past year suicide ideation among those with histories of abuse. Experiences of childhood abuse were strong risk factors for both LPI and past year suicide ideation, with significant variation by gender. While both types of abuse were significantly associated with LPI and past year suicide ideation among females, physical abuse was significantly associated with LPI and sexual abuse was associated with suicide ideation for males. Of the other characteristics examined, strong modifiable risk factors included having no one to turn to for help and no involvement in activities outside of class. Among those with LPI (n=36), nearly 20% had been pregnant or gotten someone pregnant >= 2 times, most (61.8%) reported at least one induced abortion, and current use of effective contraception was nearly non-existent. Among those with past year suicide ideation (n=30), nearly half (44.8%) reported attempting suicide.
   Conclusions: There is an urgent need for interventions to prevent and mitigate the negative influence of childhood abuse experiences. Programs providing services to orphaned youth should increase access to sexual education, effective contraceptives, and mental health counseling. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A survey of health professionals' views on acceptable gestational age and termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS
AB  - Termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly is legal in the UK with no upper limit, if two doctors, in good faith, agree "there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped". This is Clause E of the Human Fertlisation and Embryology Act. The most commonly sighted Clause is C, which states "the pregnancy has not exceeded its twenty-fourth week and that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman". This study aimed to investigate health professionals' views on gestational age and acceptable termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA).
   We undertook a questionnaire survey of UK health professionals working in fetal medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology and neonatology. A study pack consisting of a self-completion questionnaire, an invitation letter, participant information sheet, and a stamped addressed return envelope, were sent to health professionals. We used four fetal anomalies as case study examples in the questionnaire: isolated cleft lip, hypoplastic left heart, spina bifida and trisomy 21. These anomalies were chosen as they differed in terms of the type of anomaly, the type of impairment, and the perceived severity.
   Forty-one study packs were returned. For anomalies deemed less serious, later gestational ages were an important consideration when deciding acceptable TOPFA. The prognosis of an anomaly was considered an important factor in deciding whether a TOPFA was acceptable alongside gestational age. Clause C of the current UK legislation, which allows a legal termination prior to 24 weeks gestational age if continuing with the pregnancy would impact the mental health of the mother, was deemed a reasonable option for termination when parents are requesting a TOPFA. For each case study example, health professionals responded that TOPFA at '25 weeks and over' was acceptable (cleft lip n = 1; hypoplastic left heart n = 19; spina bifida n = 13 and Trisomy 21 n = 10). Professionals also distinguished between their personal and professional views.
   These findings offer new insight into how gestational age considerations influence professionals' conceptualisation of acceptable TOPFA.

TI  - Ethical, legal and societal considerations on Zika virus epidemics complications in scaling-up prevention and control strategies
T2  - PHILOSOPHY ETHICS AND HUMANITIES IN MEDICINE
AB  - Much of the fear and uncertainty around Zika epidemics stem from potential association between Zika virus (ZIKV) complications on infected pregnant women and risk of their babies being born with microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities. However, much remains unknown about its mode of transmission, diagnosis and long-term pathogenesis. Worries of these unknowns necessitate the need for effective and efficient psychosocial programs and medical-legal strategies to alleviate and mitigate ZIKV related burdens. In this light, local and global efforts in maintaining fundamental health principles of moral, medical and legal decision-making policies, and interventions to preserve and promote individual and collectiveHuman Rights, autonomy, protection of the most vulnerable, equity, dignity, integrity and beneficence that should not be confused and relegated by compassionate humanitarian assistance and support. This paper explores the potential medical and ethical-legal implications of ZIKV epidemics emergency response packages and strategies alongside optimizing reproductive and mental health policies, programs and best practice measures. Further long-term cross-borders operational research is required in elucidating Zika-related population-based epidemiology, ethical-medical and societal implications in guiding evidence-based local and global ZIKV maternal-child health complications related approaches and interventions. Core programs and interventions including future Zika safe and effective vaccines for global Zika immunization program in most vulnerable and affected countries and worldwide should be prioritized.

TI  - The Treatment of Complementary and Alternative Medicine on Female Infertility Caused by Endometrial Factors
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Recently, with the development of the social economy, the incidence of infertility has increased year by year. With its complex etiology and diversified syndromes, infertility has become one of the most important diseases that plague the physical and mental health of women of childbearing age worldwide. Endometrial factors as an important part affecting female reproductive capacity, due to which induced repeated abortion and multiple uterine cavity operations occur, can destruct endometrium, failing to provide a normal implantation environment for zygote, thus resulting in infertility. Many patients failed to achieve expected results after receiving conventional treatments such as hormone therapy, assisted reproductive technology (ART), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy, and cell therapy, then turn to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies for help. Aiming at clarifying the effectiveness and mechanisms of CAM therapy in the treatment of infertility caused by endometrial factors, our paper systematically searched and studied present related literature on the PubMed, CNKI, and other databases, focusing on the aspects of clinical application and mechanism explorations and highlighting the therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), acupuncture, and moxibustion on such diseases. Moreover, this paper also introduces the CAM treatments of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) retention enema, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), photobiomodulation therapy, dietary intervention, and other measures for infertility caused by endometrial factors, in order to provide a reference for subsequent basic research and clinical work.

TI  - Posttraumatic stress disorder in parents following infant death: A systematic review
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
AB  - Parents who have lost an infant prior to, during, or following birth often interpret the event as highly traumatic. The present systematic review included 46 articles based on 31 different studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in parents bereaved by infant death. The PTSD prevalence in mothers differed widely across studies with estimated rates at 0.6-39%. PTSD in fathers following infant foss has been less extensively studied but PTSD levels were generally much lower than in mothers with reported prevalence rates at 0-15.6% across studies. PTSD symptoms were not found to differ much depending on whether the death occurred prior to, during, or following birth and nor was gestational age consistently associated with PTSD severity. A number of risk and protective factors have been found to be associated with PTSD severity. Relevant focus areas for future research are presented along with considerations for future pregnancies and children. The suffering associated with PTSD following infant loss is overwhelming because of the rates at which such losses occur around the world. For this reason, it is problematic that not all types of infant loss resulting in sufficient symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal can elicit a DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis.

TI  - When Problems Only Get Bigger: The Impact of Adverse Childhood Experience on Adult Health
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Previous studies have shown that adverse childhood experiences negatively impact child development, with consequences throughout the lifespan. Some of these consequences include the exacerbation or onset of several pathologies and risk behaviors.
   Materials and Methods: A convenience sample of 398 individuals aged 20 years or older from the Porto metropolitan area, with quotas, was collected. The evaluation was conducted using an anonymous questionnaire that included sociodemographic questions about exposure to adverse childhood experiences, a list of current health conditions, questions about risk behaviors, the AUDIT-C test, the Fagerstrom test and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-brief form. Variables were quantified to measure adverse childhood experiences, pathologies, and risk behaviors in adult individuals for comparison purposes.
   Results: Individuals with different forms of adverse childhood experiences present higher rates of smoking dependence, self-harm behaviors, victimization of/aggression toward intimate partners, early onset of sexual life, sexually transmitted infections, multiple sexual partners, abortions, anxiety, depression, diabetes, arthritis, high cholesterol, hypertension, and stroke. Different associations are analyzed and presented.
   Discussion and Conclusions: The results show that individuals with adverse childhood experiences have higher total scores for more risk behaviors and health conditions than individuals without traumatic backgrounds. These results are relevant for health purposes and indicate the need for further research to promote preventive and protective measures.

TI  - Women generating narratives after an unwanted prenatal diagnosis result: randomized controlled trial
T2  - ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - We have defined a psychological intervention based on cognitive narrative therapy and the Ottawa decision framework to reduce adjustment problems following a termination of pregnancy (TOP) after a positive prenatal diagnosis (PND). The intervention is composed of four sessions: decision, subjectivation, metaphorization, and projecting. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a cognitive narrative intervention to prevent depression and anxiety symptoms after TOP. The intervention was accepted by 24 participants. The outcome is compared with a control group of 67 women who also terminated a pregnancy after PND. Participants were from several Portuguese institutions; 64.4% had a genetic and 35.6% had ultrasound diagnosis; the mean age was 30.0 years and the mean gestational age was 19 weeks. There are two evaluations: a baseline at the 15th day and a sixth month follow-up after TOP, using Beck Depression Inventory, Zung Anxiety Scale, Perinatal Grief Scale, and an instrument capturing participant satisfaction. Six months after TOP, there is a lower mean of anxiety and depression (p < 0.05), between groups, with effect sizes on the follow-up of 0.54 for depression, 0.41 for anxiety, and 0.23 for perinatal grief. This intervention has very positive effects on women mental health, and we emphasize the importance of the meaning-making process in the context of terminating a wanted pregnancy.

TI  - Suicide attempts during pregnancy and perinatal outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - Maternal and fetal outcomes of suicide attempts during pregnancy have rarely been examined. We examined the clinical characteristics (maternal age, gestational age in pregnancy, psychoneurological comorbidities, methods of suicide attempts) and critical perinatal outcomes among hospitalized pregnant women who attempted suicide. The current study was a nationwide retrospective cohort study using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, a national database for acute-care inpatients in Japan. We identified all pregnant women who were admitted to participating hospitals because of suicide attempts from January 2016 to March 2018. Main composite outcome was defined as critical perinatal outcomes including any of the following: induced or spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal death and maternal death. There were 319 eligible patients, of whom 126 (39.5%) had mental and behavioral disorders on admission. Blood transfusion for mother, intrauterine fetal death, and maternal death were more likely to occur in women with violent methods of suicide attempts than in women with non-violent methods. A multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that violent methods of suicide attempts (OR = 3.57 [95% CI = 1.15-11.1]) were significantly associated with critical perinatal outcomes. Healthcare providers should pay attention to mental health among pregnant women, regardless of complications of mental and behavioral disorders. The finding of associations between violent methods of suicide attempts and critical perinatal outcomes may be helpful for healthcare providers.

TI  - Gender differences in suicidal behavior in adolescents and young adults: systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - ObjectivesTo assess the association between gender and suicide attempt/death and identify gender-specific risk/protective factors in adolescents/young adults. MethodsSystematic review (5 databases until January 2017). Population-based longitudinal studies considering non-clinical populations, aged 12-26years, assessing associations between gender and suicide attempts/death, or evaluating their gender risk/protective factors, were included. Random effect meta-analyses were performed.ResultsSixty-seven studies were included. Females presented higher risk of suicide attempt (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.54-2.50), and males for suicide death (HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.8-3.6). Common risk factors of suicidal behaviors for both genders are previous mental or substance abuse disorder and exposure to interpersonal violence. Female-specific risk factors for suicide attempts are eating disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, being victim of dating violence, depressive symptoms, interpersonal problems and previous abortion. Male-specific risk factors for suicide attempt are disruptive behavior/conduct problems, hopelessness, parental separation/divorce, friend's suicidal behavior, and access to means. Male-specific risk factors for suicide death are drug abuse, externalizing disorders, and access to means. For females, no risk factors for suicide death were studied.ConclusionsMore evidence about female-specific risk/protective factors of suicide death, for adolescent/young adults, is needed.

TI  - Developmental stability, disease and medicine
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Developmental stability reflects the ability of a genotype to undergo stable development of a phenotype under given environmental conditions. Deviations from developmental stability arise from the disruptive effects of a wide range of environmental and genetic stresses, and such deviations are usually measured in terms of fluctuating asymmetry and phenodeviants. Fluctuating asymmetry is the most sensitive indicator of the ability to cope with stresses during ontogeny. There is considerable evidence that developmental stability, and especially fluctuating asymmetry, is a useful measure of phenotypic and genetic quality, because it covaries negatively with performance in multiple fitness domains in many species, including humans. It is proposed that developmental stability is an important marker of human health. Our goal is to initiate formally the integration of the sciences of evolutionary biology, developmental biology and medicine. We believe that this integrative framework provides a significant addition to the growing field of Darwinian medicine. The literature linking developmental stability and disease in humans is reviewed. Recent biological theoretical treatments pertaining to developmental stability are applied to a range of human health issues such as genetic diseases, ageing and survival, subfertility, abortion, child maltreatment by parents, cancer, infectious diseases, physiological and mental health, and physical attractiveness as a health certification.

TI  - Meta analysis of the effect of phloroglucinol combined with progesterone in the treatment of threatened miscarriage before 20 weeks of gestation: A protocol for a systematic review
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Background:Threatened miscarriage (TM) is an important factor endangering the health of pregnant women. It not only affects women's physical and mental health, but also destroys family happiness. To treat this disease, it is necessary to find a treatment with better clinical efficacy and fewer side effects. The purpose of this systematic study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of phloroglucinol (PHL) combined with progesterone in the treatment of TM before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Methods:Electronic databases (EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Elsevier, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chongqing VIP, and WanFang Data) were searched from inception until September. 2022. Randomized controlled trials of PHL combined with progesterone in the treatment of TM before 20 weeks of gestation will be included, and all articles will be independently screened and collected by 2 reviewers. Revman 5.3.5 software will be used for meta-analysis. The specific process is described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. Results:The efficacy and safety of PHL combined with progesterone for the treatment of threatened abortion were comprehensively evaluated in terms of efficacy, efficiency, time of symptom relief, length of hospital stay, and incidence of adverse events. Conclusion:This study provides reliable evidence for the clinical application of PHL combined with progesterone for the treatment of TM.

TI  - Prevalence and determinants of antenatal depression among pregnant women in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB  - Background: Antenatal depression is more prevalent in low and middle income countries as compared to high income countries. It has now been documented as a global public health problem owing to its severity, chronic nature and recurrence as well as its negative influence on the general health of women and development of children. However, in Ethiopia, there are few studies with highly variable and inconsistent findings. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of antenatal depression and its determinants among pregnant women in Ethiopia.
   Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we exhaustively searched several databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Cochrane Library. To estimate the pooled prevalence, studies reporting the prevalence of antenatal depression and its determinants were included. Data were extracted using a standardized data extraction format prepared in Microsoft Excel and transferred to STATA 14 statistical software for analysis. To assess heterogeneity, the Cochrane Q test statistics and I-2 test were used. Since the included studies exhibit considerable heterogeneity, a random effect meta- analysis model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of antenatal depression. Finally, the association between determinant factors and antenatal depression were assessed.
   Results: The overall pooled prevalence of antenatal depression, in Ethiopia, was 24.2% (95% CI: 19.8, 28.6). The subgroup analysis of this study indicated that the highest prevalence was reported from Addis Ababa region with a prevalence of 26.9% (21.9-32.1) whereas the lowest prevalence was reported from Amhara region, 17.25 (95% CI: 6.34, 28.17). Presence of previous history of abortion (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 2.1, 4.4), presence of marital conflict (OR: 7.2; 95% CI: 2.7, 19.0), lack of social support from husband (OR: 3.2: 95% CI: 1.2, 8.9), and previous history of pregnancy complication (OR: 3.2: 95% CI: 1.8, 5.8) were found to be determinants of antenatal depression.
   Conclusion: The pooled prevalence of antenatal depression, in Ethiopia, was relatively high. Presence of previous history of abortion, presence of marital conflict, lack of social support from husband, presence of previous history of pregnancy complications were the main determinants of antenatal depression in Ethiopia.

TI  - What could explain the dramatic rise in out-of-home placement in Finland in the 1990s and early 2000s?
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB  - Objectives: Despite exceptionally favourable economic conditions and school children's outstanding educational attainment the number of children placed outside their home in Finland has increased rapidly in the 1990s and early 2000s. This study identifies factors that are related to a child's risk of placement outside the home in Finland and tries to explore possible explanations for an increase in the share of children placed outside the home.
   Methods: A regression analysis was applied to study the share of children placed outside the home and suggested risk factor indicators on sub-regional level. The use of sub-regional data from SOTKAnet indicator bank allowed us to test indicators for seven areas, namely family structure (single parenthood). receipt of social assistance, unemployment, parents' alcohol and substance abuse, parents' mental health, domestic violence and abortion. Educational level, number of social workers and domestic migration were included as background factors.
   Results: Child placement outside home in Finland is most clearly associated with long-term economic hardships. However, the results indicate that the rate of change in the share of children placed outside the home is associated with alcohol and substance abuse.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that the Finnish success story as a world leader in children's issues has a darker side. A change in the distribution of welfare in Finland seems to place the children in the margin of the society into a more disadvantaged position. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Grief and ruminative thought after perinatal loss among Turkish women: one-year cohort study
T2  - SAO PAULO MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among women who have suffered loss of pregnancy, the level of grief decreases gradually. Age, mental health status and childlessness are the factors known to mostly affect women's levels of grief. OBJECTIVES: To assess the levels of grief among women who experienced perinatal loss and the changes in their ruminative thought styles over the first year after their loss. DESIGN AND SETTING: One-year follow-up study carried out in a university hospital in Turkey. METHODS: The study population included 70 women who experienced loss of pregnancy in the hospital. The sample size was calculated using G*Power V3.1. Data were collected at 48 hours, at the third month, at the sixth month and at one year after pregnancy loss, between June 2018 and June 2019. A personal information form, the Perinatal Grief Scale and the Ruminative Thought Style Questionnaire were used for data collection. RESULTS: The women's highest levels of grief and ruminative thought style were in the first 48 hours. Their tendency towards grief and ruminative thought styles decreased over the repeated measurements during the follow-up. Women aged 20-29 years had the highest levels of grief at the third month after perinatal loss. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing assessments regarding grief and ruminative thought style over the first 48 hours after perinatal loss should be integrated into nursing care for these women. Grief follow-up programs for these women can be developed through nursing research.

TI  - Suicidal ideation: Prevalence and risk factors during pregnancy
T2  - MIDWIFERY
AB  - Introduction: Although suicide is the main cause of maternal death during pregnancy in industrialized countries, there are few research regarding the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal ideation during pregnancy, especially in Spain. Method: In a multicenter study, the sample included 1,524 pregnant women recruited from an obstetrics setting from two Spanish tertiary-care public hospitals. The prevalence of prenatal suicidal ideation was estimated by analyzing their responses to item 9 on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The risk factors (which increases the probability of having suicidal ideation) included sociodemographic and biomedical variables, and the stress subscale from the revised prenatal version of the Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory (PDPI-R). Results: A total of 2.6% of pregnant women reported suicidal ideation. Risk factors of suicidal ideation during pregnancy include sociodemographic, such as prior history of depression (beta = 0.120, p < .05), unemployment (beta = 0.149, p < .05), and being an immigrant (beta = 0.140, p < .01), and biomedical variables, such as previous abortion (beta = 0.169, p < .01) and assisted reproduction (beta =-0.100, p < .05). Discussion: Given that the prevalence of suicidal ideation is higher than expected, the results of the study suggest the critical need for screening and designing preventive interventions adapted to pregnant women to decrease risk of associated suicidal behavior. In protocols carried out by midwives, specific risk factors should be included in health screenings during pregnancy. (C)& nbsp;2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.& nbsp;

TI  - Voluntary and involuntary childlessness in female veterans: associations with sexual assault
T2  - FERTILITY AND STERILITY
AB  - Objective: To assess associations between lifetime sexual assault and childlessness in female veterans.
   Design: Cross-sectional, computer-assisted telephone interview study.
   Setting: Two Midwestern Veterans Administration (VA) medical centers.
   Patient(s): A total of 1,004 women aged <= 52 years, VA-enrolled between 2000 and 2008.
   Intervention(s): None.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Sociodemographic variables, reproductive history and care utilization, and mental health.
   Result(s): A total of 620 veterans (62%) reported at least one attempted or completed sexual assault in their lifetime (LSA). Veterans with LSA more often self-reported a history of pregnancy termination (31% vs. 19%) and infertility (23% vs. 12%), as well as sexually transmitted infection (42% vs. 27%), posttraumatic stress disorder (32% vs. 10%), and postpartum dysphoria (62% vs. 44%). Lifetime sexual assault was independently associated with termination and infertility in multivariate models; sexually transmitted infection, posttraumatic stress disorder, and postpartum dysphoria were not. The LSA by period of life was as follows: 41% of participants in childhood, 15% in adulthood before the military, 33% in military, and 13% after the military (not mutually exclusive). Among the 511 who experienced a completed LSA, 23% self-reported delaying or foregoing pregnancy because of their assault.
   Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated associations between sexual assault history and pregnancy termination, delay or avoidance (voluntary childlessness), and infertility (involuntary childlessness) among female veterans. Improved gender-specific veteran medical care must attend to these reproductive complexities. (C) 2014 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

TI  - Receiving Versus Being Denied a Pregnancy Termination and Subsequent Alcohol Use: A Longitudinal Study
T2  - ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOLISM
AB  - Research finds women who terminate pregnancies are at risk of subsequent problematic alcohol use, but methodological and conceptual problems are common. This study examines the relationship between receiving versus being denied termination and subsequent alcohol use.
   Data are from a prospective, longitudinal study of US women seeking pregnancy terminations. Participants presented just before a facility's gestational limit and received terminations (Near Limits, n = 452) or just beyond the limit and were denied terminations (Turnaways, n = 231).
   Groups did not differ in alcohol use before pregnancy recognition. One week after termination-seeking (Turnaways still pregnant, Near Limits not), Turnaways had lower odds of any and binge alcohol use, but did not differ on 1+ problem symptoms. Over 2.5 years, both Near Limits and Turnaways increased any and binge alcohol use, with Turnaways increasing more rapidly. The groups did not converge again on any or binge use. For Near Limits, any alcohol use surpassed the pre-pregnancy recognition level, but binge use did not. Changes in problem symptoms over time were not evident for either group.
   While women who had a termination were more likely to report any and binge alcohol use than women who had a child, this difference was due to a reduction in consumption among women having the child rather than an increase in consumption among women having a termination. Thus, assertions that having a termination leads women to increase alcohol use to cope with having had a termination are not supported.

TI  - Understanding attitudes towards social media segregation: spatial metaphors in the discussion of Twitter blocklists
T2  - INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY
AB  - Blocking other users is a common act on Twitter but one which is underexplored from a scholarly perspective, particularly the analysis of mass blocklists. Although traditionally associated with harassment, blocklists are increasingly engaged to create individualised environments that align with users' personal convictions and exclude apparent transgressors. This study uses a pro-choice blocklist (Repeal Shield) created during the 2018 Irish abortion referendum campaign to explore how users interpret these altered boundaries and blocklists' influence on the Twitter landscape. A metaphor analysis of more than 2,000 tweets discussing the blocklist highlights the dominant concepts in how users visualise Twitter as both a personal space and a battlefield, in which mental health is a key factor. By drawing on discussions of spatiality, agency, gender and online interactions, we can see how these blocking affordances allow users to exist in spaces in which they construct their own parameters to feel safer, raising questions about how harm, health and risk are understood. The article explores how users make sense of conflicting images like 'safe spaces' or 'echo chambers', highlighting the apparent policing role held by blocklists. Users are negotiating the type of civic space in which they want to exist as norms of engagement versus avoidance collide; although digital spaces have always accommodated fragmented interests, the technological affordances of blocklists provide more rigid boundaries, highlighting how the evolving architecture of social media allows users to redefine the parameters of their own online spaces.

TI  - Motherhood as a vulnerability factor in major depression: the role of negative pregnancy experiences
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Adverse pregnancy experiences were examined retrospectively in relation to adult lifetime experience of clinical depression to see whether such experience conferred long-term risk for women. The sample consisted of just under 200 community-based women, half of whom were selected for high depressive-risk on the basis of adverse childhood experience. Over two-thirds of these women had experienced pregnancy. Adverse pregnancies were classified either in terms of loss (adverse non-live pregnancy/births) or in terms of live births in difficult circumstances (adverse live pregnancy/births). Intensive life history interviews collected details of all pregnancies, childhood neglect/abuse, marital adversity and a history of episodes of clinical depression.
   Both adverse non-live and live pregnancy experiences were significantly related to lifetime depression. The relationship remained for depression in different time periods and for those episodes unrelated to maternity experience. Both types of adverse pregnancy/birth experiences were associated with increased rates of marital problems. While adverse live pregnancy/births related to prior childhood neglect/abuse, this did not hold for those non-live. Logistic regression showed that only adverse non-live pregnancy/births together with marital adversity and childhood neglect/abuse provided the best model for lifetime depression. The findings are discussed in terms of lifetime trajectories linking difficult environments, close relationships and issues of loss. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Reciprocal relationships between life events and psychological distress
T2  - STRESS MEDICINE
CP  - 5th International Conference on Social Stress Research
AB  - We estimate a model specifying a reciprocal relationship between psychological distress and life events. The data are from two waves of an ongoing longitudinal study of adaptations to stress. Subjects are 4397 individuals who were tested in the seventh grade (time 1) and as young adults (time 4). The analysis uses the LISREL 8 program to estimate a structural model with latent variables. The model tested specifies life events as both consequences and antecedents of psychological distress, controlling for gender, race/ethnicity and SES. The life events in the aggregate mediate and partially decompose the relationship between psychological distress during adolescence and young adulthood. Time 1 psychological distress has significant positive effects on getting fired, getting married, having a child, having someone in the household become seriously ill, becoming pregnant outside of marriage, getting a divorce, moving out of the parents' home, having an abortion and getting arrested, and has significant negative effects on graduating from junior high, starting and graduating from high school, starting college, starting a job, getting promoted and borrowing money. The following life events had significant positive effects on time 4 psychological distress: having someone in the household become seriously ill, getting fired, starting high school and divorce. The following life events had significant negative effects on time 4 psychological distress: graduating junior high school, graduating from high school, starting college, getting promoted, receiving more income and borrowing money.

TI  - Intimate Partner Abuse Among Rohingya Women and Its Relationship With Their Abilities to Reject Husbands' Advances to Unwanted Sex
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
AB  - Currently, around a million Rohingya refugees live in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Displacement from homelands and restrictions on movement in the refugee camps may exacerbate intimate partner abuse (IPA) against refugee women and their abilities to reject husbands' advances to unwanted sex. This study examines Rohingya refugee women's attitudes toward and experience of intimate partner abuse (IPA) and their impact on the abilities to reject husbands' advances to unwanted sex. A survey was conducted among Rohingya refugee women in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Women's attitudes toward IPA, and experience of IPA were the exposure variables. Women's abilities to say "no" to husbands' advances to unwanted sexual intercourse was the outcome variable. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the relationships. Participants' median age was 22 years (range: 13-41). Most women perceived hitting/beatings by their husbands in certain situations as justifiable, 72% had experienced such abuse and 56.5% had to engage in unwanted sexual intercourse with their husbands. Women with increasing leniency towards hitting/beatings and those who had experienced such abuse were less likely to be able to say "no" to husbands' advances to unwanted sexual intercourse. Rohingya women's attitudes toward and experience of IPA are associated with their abilities to say "no" to husbands' advances to unwanted sex. Intervention is needed to denormalize the current practice of IPA, create awareness against IPA, and ensure formal education for girls.

TI  - Epidemiology of antenatal depression among women with high-risk pregnancies due to obstetric complications: a scoping review
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
AB  - Purpose Antenatal depression is a common mental health problem among pregnant women that negatively affects maternal and neonatal outcomes. Women with obstetric complications, defined as high-risk pregnancies, seem to be at particularly increased risk for developing depressive symptomatology. The purpose of this study was to review the prevalence of antenatal depression among pregnant women with obstetric complications and to identify possible associated factors. Methods A literature search was performed in the PubMed database and a scoping review was conducted to identify studies with data on the prevalence of antenatal depression and associated factors among high-risk pregnancies due to obstetric complications. The included studies were written in English and published up to 31/12/2018. Results The prevalence of antenatal depression among pregnant women with high-risk pregnancies ranges from 12.5 to 44.2% among the reviewed studies. The associated factors significantly associated with antenatal depression include maternal age, maternal education, dwelling place, relationship with the partner, previous psychiatric diagnosis, perceived stress, antenatal attachment, abortion thoughts, smoking, diabetes, parity, number of pregnancies, gestational age, threatened preterm labour, preeclampsia and oligohydramnios. Conclusions Our findings indicate a high prevalence of depressive disorders in women with obstetric complications, suggesting the need for more rigorous screening among this population. The identification of associated factors also merits clinical attention. Further research is warranted to develop evidence-based effective screening strategies and relevant interventions.

TI  - TNF-alpha Polymorphisms and Maternal Depression in a Mexican Mestizo Population
T2  - CNS & NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS-DRUG TARGETS
AB  - Background: Depressive disorders are common during pregnancy. There is compelling evidence that the inflammatory response system is important in the pathophysiology of depression. Higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in depressed subjects have been described. Because several polymorphisms in the TNF-a promoter region are known to affect its gene expression, the aim of this study was determine whether TNF-alpha 857C/ T, -308G/A, and -238G/A polymorphisms confer susceptibility to depression during pregnancy in a Mexican mestizo population.
   Methods: This case-control study involved 153 depressed pregnant women and 177 controls. Polymorphisms were genotyped using real-time PCR. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals adjusted by age, body mass index, number of pregnancies, months of pregnancy and number of abortions were used to estimate risk.
   Results: The -857CT genotype was found to increase the risk for depression (OR= 1.73, 95% CI= 1.06-2.82). In contrast, the -238GA genotype reduced the risk (OR= 0.33, 95% CI= 0.14-0.72). The 308G/A polymorphism was not associated with risk for depression. Finally, the C857-G308-A238 haplotype was associated with a decreased risk of depression (OR= 0.35, 95% CI= 0.15-0.82).
   Conclusion: Our results show for the first time an association between TNF-alpha -857C/T and -238G/A polymorphisms and prenatal depression in Mexican mestizo population.

TI  - Social Disparities in the Relationship Between Depression and Unintended Pregnancy During Adolescence and Young Adulthood
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
AB  - Purpose: We investigated the influence of depression on subsequent risk of unintended pregnancy and social disparities within this relationship, during adolescence and young adulthood.
   Methods: Drawing upon 15-year, nationally representative data from 8,810 young U.S. women in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we estimated associations between depression and time to first pregnancies reported as unintended, overall and stratified by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and age with Cox proportional hazard models.
   Results: Moderate/severe depression symptoms were associated with an increased risk of unintended first pregnancy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.44). In stratified models, depression increased the pregnancy risk for all minority groups (HRs, 1.36-3.25) but not white women. Depression increased the pregnancy risk for women with $0-$19,999 (HR, 1.48; CI, 1.11-1.98) and $20,000-$49,999 (HR, 1.33; CI, 1.05-1.68) income levels but not those at higher levels. Depression increased the pregnancy risk for adolescents <20 years (HR, 1.35; CI, 1.07-1.71) but decreased the risk for women >24 years (HR,.47; CI,.25-.86).
   Conclusions: Findings may inform more equitable, holistic public health strategies that target depression as a modifiable risk factor for adverse reproductive outcomes during adolescence and young adulthood. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

TI  - Addressing Stillbirth in India Must Include Men
T2  - ISSUES IN MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
AB  - Background: Millennium Development Goal 4, to reduce child mortality, can only be achieved by reducing stillbirths globally. A confluence of medical and sociocultural factors contribute to the high stillbirth rates in India. The psychosocial aftermath of stillbirth is a well-documented public health problem, though less is known of the experience for men, particularly outside of the Western context. Therefore, men's perceptions and knowledge regarding reproductive health, as well as maternal-child health are important. Methods: Key informant interviews (n = 5) were analyzed and 28 structured interviews were conducted using a survey based on qualitative themes. Results: Qualitative themes included men's dual burden and right to medical and reproductive decision making power. Wives were discouraged from expressing grief and pushed to conceive again. If not successful, particularly if a son was not conceived, a second wife was considered a solution. Quantitative data revealed that men with a history of stillbirths had greater anxiety and depression, perceived less social support, but had more egalitarian views towards women than men without stillbirth experience. At the same time fathers of stillbirths were more likely to be emotionally or physically abusive. Predictors of mental health, attitudes towards women, and perceived support are discussed. Conclusions: Patriarchal societal values, son preference, deficient women's autonomy, and sex-selective abortion perpetuate the risk for future poor infant outcomes, including stillbirth, and compounds the already higher risk of stillbirth for males. Grief interventions should explore and take into account men's perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors towards reproductive decision making.

TI  - Association of Pregnancy Contexts with Depression and Low Social Support in Early Pregnancy
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - CONTEXT Research into the relationship between pregnancy intention and perinatal depression or low social support is limited. Women's perspectives on pregnancy and their associations with perinatal depression could help in developing targeted efforts for screening and intervention. METHODS In 2014-2015, 161 women seeking pregnancy testing or abortion care at clinics in New Haven, Connecticut, were surveyed. They were asked about pregnancy context (intentions, planning, wantedness, desirability, timing and happiness), and the Edinburgh Depression Screen (EDS) and the Modified Kendler Social Support Index (MKSSI) were used to identify possible antenatal depression and low social support, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to examine associations between pregnancy context and these outcomes. RESULTS On average, participants were 27 years old and at nine weeks' gestation. One-fifth reported a previous diagnosis of depression or anxiety, and 22% and 33% screened positive for depression (EDS scores of 13 or higher and 10 or higher, respectively); 52% received low social support (MKSSI score of 3.2 or less). Regression analysis found that pregnancies described as unintended, poorly timed or undesired were associated with depression at the higher cutoff (odds ratios, 3.2-4.5); all unfavorable pregnancy measures were associated with depression at the lower cutoff. Ambivalence regarding pregnancy timing, intention, wantedness and desirability was associated with increased odds of depression by either EDS score. Unplanned pregnancies and those about which the woman was ambivalent were associated with low social support. CONCLUSIONS Findings support the need to screen women for depression early in pregnancy and to integrate assessments of pregnancy context into the evaluation of potential risk factors.

TI  - Highs and Lows of Lambing Time: Sheep Farmers' Perceptions of the First Outbreak of Schmallenberg Disease in South West England on Their Well-Being

AB  - The outbreak of a previously unknown and new disease in the United Kingdom, known as 'Schmallenberg disease', a disease associated with abortions, stillbirths and fetal deformities in naive ewes, was reported for the first time in South West England during the 2012/13 early lambing season. Epidemiological studies confirmed that the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) had a severe negative impact upon animal welfare and the productivity of affected flocks. By contrast, there was a specific lack of research on the impact of SBV on sheep farmer well-being. This study aimed to improve our understanding of sheep farmers' experiences of Schmallenberg disease, and the impact of the first outbreak on sheep farmer well-being during the 2012/13 early lambing season in South West England. Face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with six farmers with small flocks of pedigree and purebred sheep in South West England were conducted in 2013. The data were analysed via thematic analysis. The main themes regarding the impact of disease on farmer well-being included: (i) emotional highs and lows are part of a normal lambing season; (ii) negative emotions and memories associated with the Schmallenberg disease outbreak; and (iii) resilience and coping with the unexpected disease outbreak. These novel data present preliminary findings from a small number of sheep farmers, and indicate that for some farmers, an unexpected outbreak of a new and emerging disease for the first time during lambing, and dealing with high levels of dystocia, deformities and deaths in their animals, had a negative impact on their emotional well-being during the peak period of the sheep production cycle.

TI  - Pediatric treatment concepts in Europe
T2  - MONATSSCHRIFT KINDERHEILKUNDE
AB  - To promote children's health in Europe, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the European child and adolescent health strategy 2015-2020, which is supported and will be implemented by all Member States (MS). In order to measure the implementation of the strategy at country level, the WHO regional office carried out a survey in 2016, involving 48 out of 53 countries (91%). Findings from the survey will be available in a forthcoming WHO report and on the WHO website. This article presents selected results about health systems, mental and sexual and reproductive health. The primary care of children and adolescents in Europe illustrates a variety of care models, yet the majority of MS incorporate a system in which children are treated by both pediatricians and general practitioners. The survey also shows that many countries, including Germany, do not have pediatric essential drug lists or pediatric formulations of all essential drugs. Key data on mental health of adolescents derived from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, included in WHO Europe monitoring profiles of child health, has led to exemplary national actions. Access to sexual and reproductive health services continues to be a problem in many countries. A legal abortion without parental consent for adolescents under the age of 18 is only possible in less than half (48%) of the countries surveyed. This article compares the German case with that of other European countries and provides policy directions for the main childhood and youth health indicators in Europe as well as where they can be tracked. The ultimate aim is to support political dialogue, recognizing pediatricians as advocates for children, to make relevant recommendations for improving child and adolescent health.

TI  - Congruence across Sexual Orientation Dimensions and Risk for Unintended Pregnancy among Adult US Women
T2  - WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES
AB  - Objectives: To date, no studies have investigated whether sexual minority women (SMW) are more likely to experience unintended pregnancies compared with their heterosexual peers. The aim of this study was to explore whether adult SMW were more likely to have unintended pregnancies compared with heterosexual women, to examine the role of identity-attraction congruence in unintended pregnancy risk, and to evaluate possible mediators.
   Methods: Data on pregnancies to women ages 18 to 44 were drawn from the 2006 through 2013 National Survey of Family Growth (n = 25,403). Weighted logistic regression models estimated the likelihood of reporting an unintended (rather than intended) pregnancy by identity-attraction congruence and the extent to which this association was mediated by sexual experiences with men, including age at first sex and number of sexual partners. Supplementary analyses addressed the issue of abortion underreporting.
   Results: Pregnancies to SMW were more likely to be unintended compared with pregnancies to heterosexual women (adjusted odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.46). This was driven by the elevated risk experienced by heterosexual-identified women with same-sex attractions, specifically (adjusted odds ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.51). Greater unintended pregnancy risk among these women was mediated by a greater number of male sex partners compared with heterosexual women.
   Conclusions: Unintended pregnancy risk among SMW has historically received little attention from scholars and clinicians. Future research should explore the specific conditions that put heterosexual-identified women with same sex attractions at increased risk for unintended pregnancy. Clinicians should consider these dynamics when screening patients for contraceptive counseling. (C) 2016 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Homocysteine, folic acid and vitamin B-12 in relation to pre- and postnatal health aspects
T2  - CLINICAL CHEMISTRY AND LABORATORY MEDICINE
CP  - 4th Conference on Hyperhomocysteinemia
AB  - Studies linking hype rhomocysteinemia (HHCY) and B-vitamin deficiency to some health aspects in children have been accumulating. Low B-vitamin status in early life, even as early as the time of conception, may endanger the potential for new life and may negatively influence the health of the offspring. Early abortion, pregnancy complications and poor pregnancy outcomes have been linked to elevated concentrations of total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) and low folate or vitamin B-12. Maternal vitamin status predicts that of fetuses and neonates. Lactating women are likely to experience low micronutrient status, which might affect breast-milk composition and hence the nutritional status of their breast-fed infants. Elevated concentrations of methylmalonic acid (MMA) is common in infants (age < 6 months), which may indicate a transient inadequate vitamin B-12 status. Deficiency of B-vitamins might confer deleterious effects on the physical and mental health of the child, such as impaired growth, gross motor function, poor school performance and other adaptive skills. The importance of maintaining adequate B-vitamin status during periods of progressive growth and development should be emphasized because symptoms related to folate and vitamin B-12 deficiency are difficult to detect. Serum levels of tHcy and MMA should be estimated in several target groups of children, pregnant and lactating women and those planning for pregnancy. Concentrations of tHcy and MMA are useful indicators of B-vitamin status in the pediatric laboratory. Using these functional markers may facilitate detecting suboptimal B-vitamin status in children.

TI  - The relationship between intimate partner violence and unintended pregnancy: Analysis of a national sample from Colombia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PERSPECTIVES
AB  - CONTEXT: Intimate partner violence is associated with a number of reproductive and mental health problems. However, the relationship between intimate partner violence and women's ability to control their fertility has not been adequately explored, especially in developing countries.
   METHODS: Data from the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey for Colombia were used in multivariate logistic regressions to explore the relationship between intimate partner violence and unintended pregnancy, which was included as a measure of fertility control. Regional differences in the relationship were also explored and population-attributable risk estimates were calculated. The sample consisted of 3,431 ever-married women aged 75-49 who had given birth in the lost five years or were currently pregnant.
   RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of respondents had had at least one unintended pregnancy, and 38% had been physically or sexually abused by their current or most recent partner. Women's adjusted odds of having had an unintended pregnancy were significantly elevated if they had been physically or sexually abused (odds ratio, 1.4);the association was observed in the Atlantica and Central regions (1.7 each), but was not significant elsewhere in the country. Eliminating intimate partner violence in Colombia would result in an estimated 32,523-44,986 fewer unintended pregnancies each year.
   CONCLUSIONS. These findings indicate the need to include intimate partner violence screening and treatment in reproductive health programs, to promote men's involvement in fertility con trol programs, and to improve the social and political response to intimate partner violence.

TI  - Women's experiences of health care utilization in cases of early pregnancy loss: A scoping review
T2  - WOMEN AND BIRTH
AB  - Background: Approximately 25% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, most occurring within the first trimester (<13 weeks). For many women early pregnancy loss has implications for short-and long-term mental health, and women's well-being following early pregnancy loss is impacted by their experiences within the healthcare setting. To improve quality of care, it is crucial to understand women's' experiences within the healthcare system in cases of early pregnancy loss. Questions: What does the research literature tell us about the experiences of early pregnancy loss within healthcare settings? Are these experiences positive or negative? 'How can care improve for those experiencing early pregnancy loss?' Methods: A scoping review of the research literature was undertaken. Three research databases were searched for relevant articles published in English since 2009, with key words related to 'Experience', 'Healthcare' and 'Early Pregnancy Loss'. A thematic analysis was undertaken to identify and summarize key findings emerging from the research literature. Findings: Twenty-seven (27) articles met our inclusion criteria. Three main themes were identified: (1) issues related to communication, (2) challenges within care environments, and (3) inadequacies in aftercare.
   Discussion: The literature suggests that women's experiences related to healthcare for early pregnancy loss are largely negative, particularly within emergency departments. Recommendations to improve women's experiences should extend beyond attempts to improve existing care structures, to include emerging environments and providers. Conclusion: Women's experiences identified within the literature provide further insights on what women are seeking from their care, and how care models can be improved.

TI  - Machine learning to reveal an astute risk predictive framework for Gynecologic Cancer and its impact on women psychology: Bangladeshi perspective
T2  - BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - Background In this research, an astute system has been developed by using machine learning and data mining approach to predict the risk level of cervical and ovarian cancer in association to stress. Results For functioning factors and subfactors, several machine learning models like Logistics Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, kNN, CN2 rule Inducer, Decision Tree, Quadratic Classifier were compared with standard metrics e.g., F1, AUC, CA. For certainty info gain, gain ratio, gini index were revealed for both cervical and ovarian cancer. Attributes were ranked using different feature selection evaluators. Then the most significant analysis was made with the significant factors. Factors like children, age of first intercourse, age of husband, Pap test, age are the most significant factors of cervical cancer. On the other hand, genital area infection, pregnancy problems, use of drugs, abortion, and the number of children are important factors of ovarian cancer. Conclusion Resulting factors were merged, categorized, weighted according to their significance level. The categorized factors were indexed using ranker algorithm which provides them a weightage value. An algorithm has been formulated afterward which can be used to predict the risk level of cervical and ovarian cancer in relation to women's mental health. The research will have a great impact on the low incoming country like Bangladesh as most women in low incoming nations were unaware of it. As these two can be described as the most sensitive cancers to women, the development of the application from algorithm will also help to reduce women's mental stress. More data and parameters will be added in future for research in this perspective.

TI  - A decade of discoveries in veterinary protozoology changes our concept of "subclinical" toxoplasmosis
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
CP  - 20th Conference of the World-Association-for-the-Advancement-of-Veterinary-Parasitology
AB  - One of the most compelling topics to emerge from the last decade of veterinary protozoology is disease caused by a zoonotic pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, in otherwise healthy people. These findings may catch the health professions by surprise, because veterinary and medical courses and textbooks typically emphasize that T gondii infections are subclinical, unless acquired in utero or the patient has a serious immunosuppressive condition. Nevertheless, numerous reports in the last decade associate. toxoplasmosis with lymphadenopathy, fever, weakness and debilitation, ophthalmitis, and severe multisystemic infections in people who do not have immunosuppressive conditions. Toxoplasmosis in rodents causes altered behavior, and similar mental aberrations are coming to light in humans; recent studies associate T gondii infection with personality shifts and increased likelihood of reduced intelligence or schizophrenia. These conditions reduce the quality of life of individuals, and may exact a significant economic burden upon society. Of course, toxoplasmosis continues to cause serious conditions in AIDS patients and congenitally infected people, as well as abortions and encephalitis in domestic and wild animals. Environmental contamination is heavy enough to extend into marine wildlife. It is time for the health professions to amend teaching curricula regarding T gondii. Veterinary parasitologists should lead the way in developing methods to reduce the prevalence of T gondii in food animals. Public health policies should prohibit the practice of allowing pet cats to roam. Organizations and individuals that feed feral cats are unwittingly contributing to the dissemination of T gondii, by sustaining artificially dense populations of a definitive host of this protozoal parasite.

TI  - Sexual and Reproductive Health in Adolescents and Young Adults With Psychotic Disorders: A Scoping Review
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN
AB  - Background and Hypothesis The sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of young people with psychosis has been largely overlooked. We hypothesised that there are key deficiencies in the existing literature on the SRH of adolescents and young adults with psychotic disorders. Study Design We conducted a systematic scoping review using Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. We included empirical studies and case reports focused on SRH issues in young people (aged 14-24 years) with psychotic disorders. A qualitative synthesis was completed. Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools were utilized to assess study quality. Study Results Seventeen empirical studies and 52 case reports met inclusion criteria. Most focused on sexual dysfunction which was identified as common among this cohort and associated with both psychotic disorders and antipsychotics. The study population was more likely to engage in sexual risk-taking behavior and was at higher risk of sexually transmissible infections than those without psychosis. SRH topics of clinical relevance in older patients with psychosis such as pregnancy, abortion, sexual violence, coercion, sexual identity, and gender were poorly addressed in this younger group. We found empirical studies generally lacked identification and controlling of confounders whilst case reports provided limited description of mental health and SRH outcomes following clinical intervention. Conclusion Research and clinical practice addressing sexual and reproductive health is needed for young people living with psychosis. To address research gaps future studies should focus on women's health, sexual violence, gender, and sexuality in young people with psychosis.

TI  - Psychosocial Aspects of Gestational Grief in Women Undergoing Infertility Treatment: A Systematic Review of Qualitative and Quantitative Evidence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment without being able to become pregnant, and experiencing pregnancy loss after assisted reproduction, are triggering factors for prolonged grief and mourning. This review aims to investigate the psychosocial aspects of gestational grief among women who have undergone infertility treatment. We searched the databases of MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Lilacs for works published up to 5 March 2021. The outcomes analyzed were negative and positive psychosocial responses to gestational grief among women suffering from infertility and undergoing assisted human reproduction treatment. Eleven studies were included, which yielded 316 women experiencing infertility who were undergoing treatment. The most frequently reported negative psychosocial manifestations of grief response were depression (6/11, 54.5%), despair or loss of hope/guilt/anger (5/11, 45.5%), anxiety (4/11, 36.4%), frustration (3/11, 27.3%), and anguish/shock/suicidal thoughts/isolation (2/11, 18.2%). Positive psychosocial manifestations included the hope of becoming pregnant (4/6, 66.6%) and acceptance of infertility after attempting infertility treatment (2/6, 33.3%). We identified several negative and positive psychosocial responses to gestational grief in women experiencing infertility. Psychological support before, during, and after assisted human reproduction treatment is crucial for the management of psychosocial aspects that characterize the grief process of women experiencing infertility who become pregnant and who lose their pregnancy. Our results may help raise awareness of the area of grief among infertile women and promote policy development for the mental health of bereaved women.

TI  - Emotional and behavioral problems, social competence and risk factors in 6-16-year-old students in Beijing, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Introduction
   Child emotional or behavioral problems and insufficient social development has been a heavy burden on family and society. However, currently large-scale studies on emotional and behavioral problems as well as social competence among school children in China are still lacking. This cross-sectional study analyzed the current status and risk factors of behavioral problems and social competences in Beijing students.
   Method
   A total of 9,295 students, with ages ranging from 6 to 16 years old, were enrolled in the study. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to screen emotional and behavioral problems, social competences of students. We then assessed significant predictors factors associated with children behavioral problems and social competences.
   Results
   The total detection rate of behavioral problems of this cohort was 16.7%. All kinds of social competence scores of boys were lower than girls (P < 0.05). The scores of social and learning ability in children with behavioral problems were significantly lower than those without behavior problems (P < 0.05). Gender, developmental delay, recent life events, negative relationships and negative child-rearing styles were the shared influencing factors for behavioral problems and social competence. In addition, age, macrosomia, threatened abortion, hospitalization for physical illness, physical illness, poor sleep were independent risk factors for children's emotional and behavioral problems, and non-breastfeeding was an independent risk factor for abnormal social competence.
   Conclusion
   The social competence, emotional and behavioral problems are serious among students in Beijing. More attention should be paid to mental health and effective intervention measures should be provided.

TI  - Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for major depression following perinatal loss: a pilot randomized controlled trial
T2  - ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - This randomized controlled pilot trial examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an adapted interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for major depressive disorder (MDD) following perinatal loss (miscarriage, stillbirth, or early neonatal death). Fifty women who experienced a perinatal loss within the past 18 months, whose current depressive episode onset occurred during or after the loss, were randomized to the group IPT adapted for perinatal loss (the Group IPT for Major Depression Following Perinatal Loss manual developed for this study is available at no cost by contacting either of the first two authors) or to the group Coping with Depression (CWD), a cognitive behavioral treatment which did not focus on perinatal loss nor social support. Assessments occurred at baseline, treatment weeks 4 and 8, post-treatment, and 3 and 6 months after the end of treatment. IPT was feasible and acceptable in this population. Although some participants were initially hesitant to discuss their losses in a group (as occurred in IPT but not CWD), end of treatment satisfaction scores were significantly (p = 0.001) higher in IPT than in CWD. Confidence intervals around between-groups effect sizes favored IPT for reductions in depressive symptoms during treatment as well as for improvement in mode-specific targets (social support, grief symptoms) and recovery from a post-traumatic stress disorder over follow-up. This group IPT treatment adapted for MDD after perinatal loss is feasible, acceptable, and possibly efficacious.

TI  - Family-Related Opinions and Stressful Situations Associated with Psychological Distress in Women Undergoing Infertility Treatment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate how family-related opinions and stressful situations are related to psychological distress in women undergoing infertility treatment. The subjects in this cross-sectional study were recruited from female patients undergoing infertility treatment (n = 2540) at 70 infertility treatment institutions in Japan. Because of non-participation or missing data, the number of subjects included in the analysis was 635 (response rate, 25.0%). The family-related opinions and stressful situations were evaluated using the original questions. Psychological distress was assessed using a self-report measure, the Kessler Six-question Psychological Distress Scale (K6). The K6 scores of the following participants were significantly (p < 0.05) and independently high: those with more frequent miscarriage/stillbirth/abortions, those with repeated miscarriages as the cause of infertility, those with infertility of unknown causes, those living with no child, those having a low joint income with their partner, those with the opinion that "women should devote themselves to their household duties" those who had considered stopping treatment, those without the opinion that "married life without children is favorable" and those who had experienced stressful situations such as inadequate explanation by doctors, frustration of multiple failed attempts, differences of opinion with the partner, and lack of knowledge regarding when to stop treatment. Family-related opinions and stressful situations associated with psychological distress in women undergoing infertility treatment are outlined. The results of this study may contribute to the prevention of and care for psychological distress in female patients undergoing infertility treatment.

TI  - The impact of intimate partner violence on women's reproductive health and pregnancy outcome
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate and elucidate the impact of intimate partner violence (IPV) on women's reproductive health and pregnancy outcomes taking into account data from various countries. The search of the literature was made in MEDLINE database service for the years 2002-2008. Original articles, reviews, surveys, clinical trials and investigations pertinent to the theme were considered for this review. The lifetime physical or sexual IPV or both varied from 15% to 71% in many countries. Adolescent violence, negative emotionality and quality of the relationship with the intimate partner were associated with genesis of IPV, besides demographic, social and structural difference in attitudes. IPV affected woman's physical and mental health, reduced sexual autonomy, increased risk for unintended pregnancy and multiple abortions. Risk for sexual assault decreased by 59% or 70% for women contacting the police or applying for a protection order, respectively. Quality of life of IPV victims was found significantly impaired. Women battered by IPV reported high levels of anxiety and depression that often led to alcohol and drug abuse. Violence on pregnant women significantly increased risk for low birth weight infants, pre-term delivery and neonatal death and also affected breast-feeding postpartum. Women preferred an active role to be played by healthcare providers in response to IPV disclosure. Gynaecologists reported interventions for the patient disclosing IPV and provided treatment for their physical and emotional complaints. Educating and empowering women and upgrading their socioeconomic status may abate the incidence of IPV. Women should also seek protection against IPV.

TI  - A Qualitative Analysis of Disclosure Patterns among Women with Sexual Violence-Related Pregnancies in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has experienced nearly two decades of civil conflict in the Eastern regions of North and South Kivu. This conflict has been notorious for the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, leading in many cases to pregnancy after rape. The objectives of this analysis were: 1) to describe patterns of sexual violence-related pregnancy (SVRP) disclosure; 2) to consider why survivors chose to disclose to particular individuals; and 3) to examine the dialogue around SVRPs between women with SVRPs and their confidants. In South Kivu Province, Democratic Republic of Congo, two subgroups of sexual violence survivors completed qualitative interviews, those currently raising a child from an SVRP (parenting group, N = 38) and those who had terminated an SVRP (termination group, N = 17). The findings show that a majority of SVRPs were conceived when participants were held in sexual captivity for prolonged periods of time. The SVRPs were disclosed to friends, family members, other sexual violence survivors, community members, spouses, health care providers, or perpetrators. The confidants were most often chosen because they were perceived by the participants as being discreet, trusted, and supportive. The confidants often provided advice about continuing or terminating the SVRP. Trust and discretion are the most important factors determining to whom women with SVRPs disclose their pregnancies. The vital role of confidants in giving support after disclosure cannot be overlooked. Providing opportunities for survivors to safely disclose their SVRPs, including to health care providers, is a necessary first step in allowing them to access safe and comprehensive post-assault care and services.

TI  - Intimate relationships and childbearing after adolescent depression: a population-based 15 year follow-up study
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Adolescent depression is associated with a range of interpersonal adversities. We hypothesized that depressed adolescents are at subsequent increased risk of problems related to intimate relationships and childbearing in adulthood, and used longitudinal data to examine this.
   A population-based investigation of depression in 16 to 17 year olds was followed up after 15 years, at around the age of 30 years. Comparisons were made between adolescents with depression (n = 361, 78% females) and non-depressed peers (n = 248, 77% females). Data from both national registers and personal interviews were used.
   At follow-up, the former depressed and non-depressed adolescents had become parents to a similar extent. The former depressed females were more likely than the non-depressed females to report abortion, miscarriage, intimate partner violence and sexually transmitted disease. They also reported a higher number of intimate relationships and were more likely to have divorced and to be registered as single mothers. Depressed females with a comorbid disruptive disorder had a particularly poor outcome. In the depressed females without a disruptive disorder, only those who subsequently had recurrent depressions in adulthood were at increased risk of poor outcome. There was no indication that the formerly depressed males were at increased risk of subsequent problems related to intimate relationships.
   Females with adolescent depression subsequently have problems related to intimate relationships and childbearing. Disruptive disorders and recurrence of depression appear to be instrumental in this association. Attention should be given to intimate relationship problems and sexual and reproductive health issues in young women with depression.

TI  - Perceptions of the rape crisis in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo: A community-based approach using an opportunistic design
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - For almost three decades, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has experienced cycles of armed conflict, particularly in the east. During these conflicts, systematic rape has been used as a weapon of war to break women and communities. Knowledge produced about this phenomenon to date relates to the epidemiology, aetiology and the consequences of these rapes, particularly on survivors in care institutions, thus ignoring the impact this phenomenon has on the communities. Our survey aims to investigate the extent to which women from the Orientale, North Kivu and South Kivu provinces have experienced rape, as well as their perceptions regarding its frequency, characteristics, and repercussions for/on victims in their communities. From a sample of 1483 women, more than 99% had directly or indirectly experienced rape, on at least five occasions in three-quarters of cases. In their experience, a large proportion of the rapes took place at the victims' homes in the presence of family members and were perpetrated by members of military or paramilitary groups. Frequent health problems (several possibilities) reported include: bleeding (40.8%), pain (23.9%); unwanted pregnancies/abortions (23.4%), urogenital problems including STD (12.0%). Concerning mental health, they reported fear and anxiety (56.3%), depression and suicidal thoughts (16.8 %), insomnia (5.3%); 94.7% reported feelings of humiliation and shame and 6.9% social exclusion and stigmatization. Support for victims comes largely from NGOs (47.6%), families (27.1%) and Churches (14.3%). This is a major cultural, economic, political, human rights, and public health problem, which the authorities and international community must commit to tackling.

TI  - Effect of the 2015 Nepal Earthquakes on symptoms of common mental disorders among women who are pregnant
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Antenatal mental health problems are of concern globally not only because of the burden and limits to participation experienced by women but also because of risks for foetal neurocognitive development and adverse birth outcomes. The aim was to describe the indicative prevalence of and risk and protective factors for clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal common mental disorders (CMDs) among women who experienced the 2015 Nepal earthquakes during pregnancy.
   Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study in Bhaktapur, one of 14 districts highly affected by the 2015 Nepal earthquakes. The primary outcome, clinically significant symptoms of CMDs, was ascertained using the Nepali validation of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS-N). In order to investigate potential trauma reactions, a subset of EPDS items as indicators of trauma symptoms was constructed. Standardised instruments and study-specific questions were used to measure potential risk and protective factors. Data were collected in individual structured interviews by trained health researchers. Hierarchical multiple linear regression models were used to establish risk and protective factors for clinically significant symptoms of CMDs and indicators of post-earthquake trauma reaction.
   Results: Overall, 497/498 eligible pregnant women provided complete data. We found that 21.9% (95% CI, 18.4; 25.8) of participants had EPDS-N scores> 12 and another 17.1% (95% CI 13.9; 20.7) scored 10-12 indicating a high prevalence of clinically significant CMD symptoms. In total, 20 factors were included in the final hierarchical multiple linear regression model and together explained 33.3% of the variance in EPDS total scores; seven factors, including earthquake experiences and lifetime experience of intimate partner violence, increased risk and five including having income-generating work and a kind, and encouraging partner were protective. The association between earthquake experiences and the indicators of trauma symptoms was not significant in the hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis.
   Limitations: The EPDS has not yet been formally validated in Nepal for use during pregnancy. Data were collected 6 months post-earthquake, so we were not able to capture the experiences of women who had spontaneous or induced abortions or premature births in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake.
   Conclusions: In addition to the restoration of antenatal and obstetric services, the mental health of women who are pregnant requires specific consideration and interventions after natural disasters. This should take into account the additional adverse impact of violence perpetrated by an intimate partner.

TI  - Intimate Partner Violence and Its Associations with Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy is a significant issue. Nevertheless, the prevalence of IPV and its adverse outcomes in pregnant women in Saudi Arabia are not well documented. This study examines the prevalence of IPV, its relationship with women's background characteristics, and its effect on adverse pregnancy outcomes. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a convenience sample of 684 women who were either pregnant or in the first six weeks postpartum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. IPV severity was measured using the Composite Abuse Scale. The results showed that 28.9% of the women included in this study experienced IPV. Smoking habit, income, polygamous marriage, presence of chronic diseases and sexual dysfunction, and number of children were significantly associated with IPV severity. In each one-unit increase in total IPV severity, the possibility of the occurrence of preterm labor, vaginal bleeding, dehydration, gestational diabetes, urinary tract infection, spontaneous abortion, and intrauterine growth retardation significantly increases. Furthermore, regarding the types of abuse, we found that for each one-unit increase in verbal abuse, the possibility of the occurrence of preterm labor, dehydration, urinary tract infection, and intrauterine growth retardation significantly increases. Moreover, for each one-unit increase in physical abuse and one-unit increase in controlling behavior, the possibility of the occurrence of intrauterine growth retardation significantly increases. The current results highlight the importance of paying substantial attention to IPV and its types as a health issue that increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women. A clinical assessment during pregnancy is needed to identify and manage cases of IPV survivors and ultimately reduce their risk of IPV.

TI  - Moderators and mediators of the relationship between receiving versus being denied a pregnancy termination and subsequent binge drinking
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE
AB  - Background: Women who terminate pregnancies drink more subsequent to the pregnancy than women who give birth, including women who give birth after seeking to terminate a pregnancy.
   Methods: Data are from the Turnaway Study, a prospective, longitudinal study of 956 women who sought to terminate pregnancies at 30 U.S. facilities. This paper focuses on the 452 women who received terminations just below facility gestational limits and 231 who were denied terminations because they presented just beyond facility gestational limits. This study examined whether baseline characteristics moderate the relationship between termination and subsequent binge drinking and whether stress, feelings about the pregnancy, and number of social roles mediate the relationship.
   Results: Only having had a previous live birth modified the termination binge drinking relationship. Among women with previous live births, binge drinking was reduced among women carrying to term compared to terminating the pregnancy. Among women who had not had a previous live birth, however, the reduction in binge drinking among those denied termination was not sustained over time, and binge drinking of those who had and had not had terminations converged by 2.5 years. Neither stress, negative emotions, nor social roles mediated effects on binge drinking. Positive emotions at one week mediated effects on binge drinking at six months, although positive emotions at two years did not mediate effects on binge drinking at 2.5 years.
   Conclusions: Higher levels of binge drinking among those who terminate pregnancies do not appear due to stress or to negative emotions. Only parous women and not nulliparous women denied terminations experienced sustained reductions in binge drinking over time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The association between psychosocial interventions and fertility treatment outcome: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Does psychosocial intervention affect pregnancy outcomes in women and couples undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment?.
   Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of psychosocial intervention on pregnancy outcomes in women and couples undergoing ART treatment. The primary outcome was Pregnancy Rates. Secondary outcomes were Live Birth Rate (LBR) and Abortion Rate (AR).
   Materials and methods: Databases searched were Pubmed, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL and The Cochrane Library. 1439 records were screened, 15 were eligible and included in the meta-analyses (N = 2434). Data was extracted using the Covidence software. Effect sizes were reported as relative risks with 95% confidence-intervals and p-values.
   Results: A positive association was found between psychosocial intervention and pregnancy rates (RR = 1.12 CI=(1.01;1.24), p = 0.033). Long-duration interventions and mind-body intervention types were found to be associated with increased pregnancy rates (RR 1.21, CI= (1.04;1.43), p = 0.017) and (RR = 1.25, CI= (1.00;1.55), p = 0.046) respectively. Q and I(2)tests suggested no to low heterogeneity. Funnel plots, Trim and Fill analyses and Fail-safe numbers were applied to adjust for possible publication bias.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest a positive association between psychosocial interventions, particularly long-duration interventions, and pregnancy rate in infertile women and couples in ART treatment. The findings are in line with findings from other reviews and meta-analyses exploring the same topic. More good quality RCTs need to be performed to increase the quality of guidance for infertile women and couples. The effect of psychosocial interventions on LBR and AR remain to be examined.

TI  - Improving emergency care for battered women
T2  - EMERGENCIAS
AB  - Objective: To analyze the frequent use of emergency health services by battered women, risk factors for abuse, detection by health care staff, and referral to social services, with a view to improving quality of care
   Methods: Prospective, cross-sectional, observational study of battered women receiving emergency care from the municipal health care services (IMAS, Institut Municipal d'Assistencia Sanitaria) in Barcelona. Data were recorded on a standardized data collection sheet Individuals who used the services at least 3 times in 2004 were considered frequent users
   Results: The emergency services handled 157 482 calls for assistance from patients over the age of 14 years; 79 787 (50.1%) were women. Gender-based violence accounted for 0.76% of the cases. Health care personnel detected gender-based violence in 10.4% Of these, 29.6% women were frequent users. Nonspecific disorders, gynecologic complaints, trauma, psychiatric disorders, digestive complaints, and neurologic symptoms were significantly more frequent (P< 001) than other reasons for seeking care Risk factors for gender-based violence were present in 52.6% of the cases, the most common factors being pregnancy, prior abortions, nonconsensual sex, and escalating violence. Social services were not contacted in 3% of the cases.
   Conclusions: Nearly a third of women suffering from gender based violence and more were frequent users of emergency services and more than half these women had risk factors. The rate of detection by health care staff was low (10.4%). The committee for assistance to battered women has adopted the following measures to improve quality of care. 1) training courses for first-year residents and continuing professional development courses for members of the staff; 2) computerization of the data collection sheet, including the most common risk factors in our health care area; and 3) routine detection systems.

TI  - Community level effects of gender inequality on intimate partner violence and unintended pregnancy in Colombia: testing the feminist perspective
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Violence against women, especially by intimate partners, is a serious public health problem that is associated with physical, reproductive, and mental health consequences. The effect of intimate partner violence on women's ability to control their fertility and the mechanisms through which these phenomena are related merit further investigation. Building on findings from a previous analysis in which a statistically significant relationship between intimate partner violence and unintended pregnancy in Colombia was found, this analysis examines the effect of gender inequality on this association using data from the 2000 Colombian Demographic and Health Survey. Specifically, the objective of this analysis is to explore whether gender inequality (as measured by women's autonomy, women's status, male patriarchal control, and intimate partner violence) in municipalities partially explains the association between intimate partner violence and unintended pregnancy in Colombia. Results of logistic regression analysis with multi-level data show that living in a municipality with high rates of male patriarchal control significantly increased women's odds of having an unintended pregnancy by almost four times. Also, living in a municipality with high rates of intimate partner violence increased one's odds of unintended pregnancy by more than 2.5 times, and non-abused women living in municipalities with high rates of intimate partner violence were at a significantly increased risk of unintended pregnancy. In addition, abused women living in a municipality with high personal female decision-making autonomy had more than a fourfold increased risk of having an unintended pregnancy. These findings demonstrate the need for reproductive health programs to target areas at particularly high risk for unintended pregnancy by reducing intimate partner violence and gender inequality.

TI  - Health care system barriers and facilitators to early prenatal care among diverse women in Florida
T2  - BIRTH-ISSUES IN PERINATAL CARE
AB  - Background Worldwide, women continue to experience barriers to accessing early prenatal care. Given the unique nature of the United States health care system, this study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to early prenatal care reported by women in Florida.
   Methods A mixed-methods study of postpartum women with entry to care after 14 weeks' gestation was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Florida. First, eligible women completed a survey including demographic characteristics and open-ended questions on prenatal care barriers. Second, a semi-structured interview was conducted to contextualize the conditions of access. The qualitative analysis was based on the combined theoretical frameworks of Phillippi and Khan.
   Results The majority of the 55 participants self-identified as Hispanic (n = 28, 51%), non-Hispanic White (n = 12, 22%), or non-Hispanic Black (n = 9, 16%). Quantitative analysis identified frequent barriers, including the following: "couldn't get an appointment when wanted one" (n = 24, 47%); "didn't have insurance" (n = 21, 41%); and "not aware of pregnancy" (n = 21, 41%). From the combined quantitative and qualitative analyses, three major themes emerged that help to explain barriers faced by birthing people in Florida: personal factors (mental health, awareness of pregnancy, considering abortion, tumultuous life), community conditions (transportation, stigma/fear, social support), and health care system (language barriers, delay at clinic level, cost of care).
   Discussion Barriers to early prenatal care are multifaceted and operate at personal, societal, and health care systems levels. Prenatal care practitioners have multiple potential targets for interventions at the clinic level to help mitigate barriers to early prenatal care. Strategies should include health care policy reforms to Medicaid access and interventions at the clinic level aimed at fast-tracking access to care.

TI  - Factors associated with non-participation in cervical cancer screening - A nationwide study of nearly half a million women in Denmark
T2  - PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Cervical cancer occurs most often in under-screened women. In this nationwide register study, we described differences in sociodemographic characteristics between passive and active non-participants and examined socio-demographic characteristics, reproductive history, and mental and physical health as potential determinants for passive non-participation compared with participation in the Danish cervical cancer screening program. Screening history in women aged 23-49 years invited for cervical cancer screening in 2008-2009 was retrieved from the Danish Pathology Databank with information about dates of invitation and unsubscription. We identified participants (n = 402,984), active non-participants (n = 10,251) and passive non-participants (n = 63,435) within four years following baseline invitation and retrieved data about the study population from high-quality registries. We examined differences in socio-demographic characteristics of passive and active non-participants, and used multiple logistic regression analyses to identify potential determinants of passive non-participation. We found that active and passive non-participants differed in relation to socio-demography. When compared with screening participants, the odds of passive non-participation was increased in women who originated from less developed countries; were unmarried; had basic education or low income; had four or more children; smoked during pregnancy; had multiple induced abortions; or had a history of obesity, intoxicant abuse or schizophrenia or other psychoses. In conclusion, in this nationwide, prospective, population-based study, differences in socio-demographic characteristics between passive and active non-participants were found. Furthermore, sociodemography, reproductive history, and mental and physical health were determinants for passive non-participation. Addressing inequalities in screening attendance may help to further decrease the incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer.

TI  - Pregnancy loss following miscarriage and termination of pregnancy for medical reasons during the COVID-19 pandemic: a thematic analysis of women's experiences of healthcare on the island of Ireland
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB  - BackgroundLosing a baby during pregnancy can be a devastating experience for expectant parents. Many report dedicated, compassionate healthcare provision as a facilitator of positive mental health outcomes, however, healthcare services have been severely impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic.AimTo explore women's experiences of healthcare service provision for miscarriage and termination of pregnancy for medical reasons (TFMR) on the island of Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsFindings combine data from elements of two separate studies. Study 1 used a mixed methods approach with women who experienced miscarriage and attended a hospital in Northern Ireland. Study 2 was qualitative and examined experiences of TFMR in Northern Ireland and Ireland. Data analysed for this paper includes open-ended responses from 145 women to one survey question from Study 1, and semi-structured interview data with 12 women from Study 2. Data were analysed separately using Thematic Analysis and combined for presentation in this paper.ResultsCombined analysis of results indicated three themes, (1) Lonely and anxiety-provoking experiences; (2) Waiting for inadequate healthcare; and (3) The comfort of compassionate healthcare professionals.ConclusionsWomen's experiences of healthcare provision were negatively impacted by COVID-19, with the exclusion of their partner in hospital, and delayed services highlighted as particularly distressing. Limited in-person interactions with health professionals appeared to compound difficulties. The lived experience of service users will be helpful in developing policies, guidelines, and training that balance both the need to minimise the risk of infection spread, with the emotional, psychological, and physical needs and wishes of parents. Further research is needed to explore the long-term impact of pregnancy loss during a pandemic on both parents and health professionals delivering care.

TI  - Effect of folic acid supplementation on diminished ovarian reserve: study protocol of a single-centre, open-label, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction The prevalence of diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), a common gynaecological disorder, is approximately 10% across the world. Failure in early diagnosis and treatment may result in continuous decreases in ovarian function and the resultant loss in an opportunity of pregnancy, which greatly affects the happiness of the women's family and women's physical and mental health. Nevertheless, there has been no effective treatment for such a disorder until now. Folic acid, a member of the vitamin B family, is involved in one-carbon cycle and methylation regulation. It has been found that folic acid affects the whole period of pregnancy, and folic acid supplementation has shown effective to remarkably reduce the incidence of fetal neural tube defects and decrease plasma homocysteic acid levels, thereby resulting in a decline in the incidence of abortion. In addition, folic acid is reported to mediate ovarian functions. It is therefore hypothesised that folic acid may improve DOR. Methods and analysis A single-centre, open-label, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial is designed. We plan to recruit 140 women with DOR at ages of 30-35 years. All participants will be randomised into the folic acid group and placebo group, and each subject will be given a tablet with the same appearance daily for 6 months. The primary outcome is antral follicle count, and the secondary outcomes are ovarian reserve markers, ovarian low-dose stimulation responses and safety. Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Nanping First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University on 10 February 2021 (approval number: NPSY202002042). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to randomisation, following a detailed description of the purpose of the study. The results of this clinical trial will be presented at scientific conferences and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.

TI  - Changes in Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug Use Over Five Years After Receiving Versus Being Denied a Pregnancy Termination
T2  - JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS
AB  - Objective: Research on effects of pregnancy termination on women's alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) use suffers from methodological and conceptual problems. Improving on prior methodologies, this study examines changes in ATOD use over 5 years among women seeking terminations. Method: Data are from the Turnaway Study, a longitudinal study of 956 women seeking terminations at 30 U.S. facilities. Participants presented just below a facility's gestational limit and received terminations (Near-Limits) or just beyond the limit and were denied terminations (Turnaways). Using mixed-effects logistic regression, we assessed differences in ATOD use over 5 years among Near-Limits and Turnaways. Results: There were no differences in ATOD use before pregnancy recognition; 1 week after termination seeking, Turnaways had lower odds than Near-Limits of any and heavy episodic alcohol use (p<.001), but not alcohol problem symptoms, tobacco use, or other drug use. Although both groups increased in any alcohol use over time, Turnaways increased more rapidly. Neither group increased any other ATOD measures over time. Turnaways' lower odds of heavy episodic alcohol use at 1 week after termination seeking were maintained throughout the subsequent 5 years. There was no differential change in problem alcohol use or in tobacco or other drug use over time, yet fewer Turnaways than Near-Limits reported problem alcohol symptoms 6 months through 3.5 years. Conclusions: There is no indication that terminating a pregnancy led women to increase heavy episodic or problem alcohol use or to increase tobacco or other drug use. Women denied terminations had temporary or sustained reductions in all alcohol measures, but not tobacco or other drugs, suggesting that relationships between pregnancy/parenting and ATOD differ across substances.

TI  - A Systematic Scoping Review on Migrant Health Coverage in Thailand
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - (1) Background: Thailand is a major migrant receiving country and pioneer of migrant health policy in the ASEAN region. However, on the ground, coverage of migrants is faced with multiple barriers. (2) Objectives: We aim to scope and analyse the types of available evidence on migrant health coverage in Thailand and identify knowledge gaps. Specifically, we characterise the literature along year of publication, migrant subpopulation, health domain, scope of coverage, methods, study design, objectives and results. (3) Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Cochrane Database, Worldwide Science and the Asian Citation Index for peer-reviewed and grey literature in October 2021 for studies analysing original data on health coverage of migrants in Thailand. To conceptualise health coverage, we used the three dimensions availability, accessibility and acceptability. (4) Results: 101 articles were included in the final analysis. Sixty-three were published after 2016, 39 focused on migrant workers and 18 on migrants in general. Forty-two concentrated on health in broader terms, followed by reproductive and maternal health (n = 31). Thirty-eight assessed coverage of specific services and 36 health coverage in general. Migrants themselves and key informants were the main data sources in 80 and 43 of the articles, respectively. Forty publications were qualitative, while 38 applied quantitative methods (22% descriptive; 7% analytical). Among the health coverage components, 79 articles included aspects of accessibility, followed by acceptability (n = 59) and availability (n = 30). (5) Conclusions: While there is a high number and broad range of studies on migrant health coverage in Thailand, we found that research on migrant subgroups, such as victims of trafficking and migrant children, as well as on the health domains, non-communicable diseases and occupational and mental health is neglected.

TI  - Prevalence and Associated Factors of Common Mental Disorders Among Pregnant Mothers in Rural Eastern Ethiopia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - BackgroundAntenatal common mental disorder is a significant public health issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries with an extensive treatment gap. Common mental disorders have multifaceted implications on maternal and fetal health outcomes during pregnancy with long-running economic and social sequels. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of common mental disorder and associated factors among pregnant mothers in eastern Ethiopia, Kersa and Haramaya Health, and Demographic surveillance sites. MethodsA community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Kersa and Haramaya health and demographic surveillance sites from January 30 to April 30, 2021. World Health Organization Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to measure common mental disorder among 1,015 randomly selected pregnant women. Data were collected face-to-face using open data kit software. Logistic regression was fitted to identify factors associated with common mental disorders. ResultsThe overall prevalence of common mental disorders (SRQ > 6) among pregnant women was 37.5% (95% CI: 34.5, 40.5). Current substance use (AOR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.37, 2.88), intimate partner violence (AOR = 2.67, 95% CI 2.02, 3.53), null parity (AOR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.65, 5.84), gestational age [first trimester (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.01, 4.93) and third trimester (AOR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.31, 2.31)], history of abortion (AOR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.27, 3.24), and absence of antenatal care follow-up (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.08, 1.89) were significantly associated with common mental disorder during pregnancy. ConclusionCommon mental disorders are prevalent among pregnant women in the study area with significant correlates. Administration of regular screening programs for maternal mental health conditions in rural, low-income communities, integrating into primary health care settings is imperative to reduce the risk.

TI  - Chronic anal fissure from suspected adult sexual abuse in a traumatic anal sex practice patient
T2  - ACTA CHIRURGICA BELGICA
AB  - The aetiopathogenesis of chronic anal fissure (CAF) is unclear and is probably multifactorial. CAF represents 10-15% of proctological consultations. This case report identifies adulthood sexual abuse as a significant risk and a potential aetiopathogenic factor of CAF. This case history was discovered while carrying out administrated interviews during, authors' clinical retrospective study on CAF.
   The clinical presentation of this 49-year-old woman is predominated by chronic anal lesions (anal tears in the anoderm, anal sphincter hypertrophy), associated medical history as a high consumer of healthcare with very poor mental health, chronic traumatic anal sex practice history, and especially persistent recurrences of gastro-intestinal symptoms after surgery. Surgical history is summarized as : 7x spontaneous abortion; 5x fistulectomy and 3x anal abscess 4x Bartholin's gland; 4 x hypertrophy papilla ablation; 2x anal manometry, 2x fissurectomy and I x sphincterotomy 2x haemorrhoid; and I x hysterectomy. These symptoms initially started and the operations in particular took place after she was married.
   After 26 years of sexual abuse within her marriage, the clinical diagnosis was made and was consented by this patient. A referral to a psychiatrist was evident and a long course of multidisciplinary therapy (medical, surgical, physiological and psychological approaches) seemed to be of benefit, in terms of improving the clinical symptoms. Authors suggest that physicians should suspect sexual abuse in any patient with a medical history as a high consumer of healthcare and especially when there is persistent recurrence after the lateral subcutaneous internal sphincterotomy. We recognise that the link or causality is difficult to prove and further study is probably needed to shed light on the link between sexual abuse and CAF : although in the United Kingdom, over 20.83% of the population are subject to sexual abuse. 83%.

TI  - First trimester depression and/or anxiety disorders increase the risk of low birthweight in IVF offspring: a prospective cohort study
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE BIOMEDICINE ONLINE
AB  - Research question: Are maternal depression and/or anxiety disorders (MDAD) before and during pregnancy associated with IVF outcomes?
   Design: A total of 5661 women starting their first IVF cycle between 15 August 2014 and 31 December 2015 were pooled from a prospective cohort of IVF-conceived children. The self-rating depression scale (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) were used to determine MDAD. IVF outcomes were compared between MDAD+ and MDAD- groups.
   Results: A total of 10.3% (572/5556) of women had MDAD before IVF (bMDAD). The fertilization rate was lower in the bMDAD+ group (59.41 +/- 22.11% versus 61.72 +/- 22.18%, P-adjust < 0.05). No difference was found in the other IVF outcomes. Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in women with singleton live births were similar between the two groups. A total of 174% (347) women with singleton live births had MDAD during the first trimester (pMDAD). Birthweight (3383 +/- 556 g versus 3447 +/- 518 g, P-adjust < 0.05) was lower and incidence of low birthweight (LBW) (6.9% versus 3.3%, P-adjust < 0.01) was higher in the pMDAD group. After adjustment for potential confounders (gestational age, maternal age, maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, threatened abortion, hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus), pMDAD remained significantly associated with LBW (odds ratio [OR] 2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.16-5.42, P-adjust < 0.05). The preconception psychological state in the pMDAD group did not demonstrate any additional impact on neonatal outcomes.
   Conclusions: MDAD during the first trimester is associated with increased risk of LBW in offspring, whether preconception MDAD exists or not.

TI  - Study protocol: 'a large cohort study of postnatal events in a not-for-profit referral centre in Vellore, South India'
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - IntroductionIn a large developing country, with diverse population characteristics and differential access to healthcare, it is important to identify factors that influence postnatal health. This knowledge will help frame recommendations to enhance universal postnatal care.Methods and analysisA prospective cohort study will be conducted by recruiting all participants who deliver in a referral centre in South India during a 1-year period after written consent is obtained from them. In addition to clinical information pertaining to their delivery and demographics, details of physical health, mental health socioeconomic status and emotional support will also be collected. Every participant will be followed up physically and/or by telephonic consultation at 3, 9 and 18 months of their postnatal period to reassess their status and that of their babies. As there are several independent and dependent variables requiring multivariate analysis, a sample size of 10 000 is considered adequate. Any unplanned visits to a health facility will be enquired into and documented for analysis.During data analysis, the effect of Caesarean section, high-risk characteristics and gestational age of the baby at delivery on various outcome measures and postnatal status will be evaluated. Interpretation of the large volume of collected data will help frame recommendations to improve postnatal careEthics and disseminationThe study is approved by the Institutional Review Boards (Research and Ethics Committees) of Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India (IRB 12178 date 24 June 2020).Women are provided with a detailed information sheet and written consent is obtained. They are reassured that their care will not be compromised if they do not consent to the study. Data will be available on the clinical trial portal to assist in the dissemination of results after the project is published.

TI  - Association Between Forced Sexual Initiation and Health Outcomes Among US Women
T2  - JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - IMPORTANCE The #MeToo movement has highlighted how frequently women experience sexual violence. However, to date, no recent studies have assessed the prevalence of forced sex during girls' and women's first sexual encounter or its health consequences.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of forced sexual initiation among US women and its association with subsequent reproductive, gynecologic, and general health outcomes.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional analysis of the 2011-2017 National Survey of Family Growth was conducted, including a population-based sample of 13 310 US women. The study was conducted from September 2011 to September 2017.
   EXPOSURES Self-reported forced vs voluntary first sexual intercourse.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of forced sexual initiation, age of woman and partner/assailant at first sexual encounter, and odds ratios (ORs) (adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics) for having an unwanted first pregnancy or abortion, development of painful pelvic conditions, and other reproductive and general health measures.
   RESULTS A total of 13310 women between the ages of 18 and 44 years were included in the study. After survey weights were applied, 6.5% (95% CI, 5.9%-7.1%) of respondents reported experiencing forced sexual initiation, equivalent to 3 351 733 women in this age group nationwide. Age at forced sexual initiation averaged 15.6 (95% CI, 15.3-16.0) years vs 17.4 (95% CI, 17.3-17.5) years for voluntary sexual initiation (P < .001). The mean age of the partner/assailant at first sexual encounter was 6 years older for women with forced vs voluntary sexual initiation (27.0; 95% CI, 24.8-29.2 years vs 21.0; 95% CI, 20.6-21.3 years). Compared with women with voluntary sexual initiation, women with forced sexual initiation were more likely to experience an unwanted first pregnancy (30.1% vs 18.9%; adjusted OR [aOR], 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.4) or an abortion (24.1% vs 17.3%; aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0), endometriosis (10.4% vs 6.5%; aOR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3), pelvic inflammatory disease (8.1% vs 3.4%; aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.5-3.4), and problems with ovulation or menstruation (27.0% vs 17.1%; aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.3). Survivors of forced sexual initiation more frequently reported illicit drug use (2.6% vs 0.7%; aOR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.8-7.0), fair or poor health (15.5% vs 7.5%; aOR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.7), and difficulty completing tasks owing to a physical or mental health condition (9.0% vs 3.2%; aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.0-3.9).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Forced sexual initiation in women appears to be common and associated with multiple adverse reproductive and general health outcomes. These findings highlight the possible need for public health measures and sociocultural changes to prevent sexual violence, particularly forced sexual initiation.

TI  - A scoping review of the determinants of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder in South Africa: an intersectional perspective
T2  - HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB  - Foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) affects babies born to mothers who consume alcohol while pregnant. South Africa has the highest prevalence of FASD in the world. We review the social determinants underpinning FASD in South Africa and add critical insight from an intersectional feminist perspective. We undertook a scoping review, guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Drawing from EBSCOhost and PubMed, 95 articles were screened, with 21 selected for analysis. We used the intersectionality wheel to conceptualize how the social and structural determinants of FASD identified by the literature are interconnected and indicative of broader inequalities shaping the women and children affected. Key intersecting social determinants that facilitate drinking during pregnancy among marginalized populations in South Africa documented in the existing literature include social norms and knowledge around drinking and drinking during pregnancy, alcohol addiction and biological dependence, gender-based violence, inadequate access to contraception and abortion services, trauma and mental health, and moralization and stigma. Most of the studies found were quantitative. From an intersectional perspective, there was limited analysis of how the determinants identified intersect with one another in ways that exacerbate inequalities and how they relate to the broader structural and systemic factors undermining healthy pregnancies. There was also little representation of pregnant women's own perspectives or discussion about the power dynamics involved. While social determinants are noted in the literature on FASD in South Africa, much more is needed from an intersectionality lens to understand the perspectives of affected women, their social contexts and the nature of the power relations involved. A critical stance towards the victim/active agent dichotomy that often frames women who drink during pregnancy opens up space to understand the nuances needed to support the women involved while also illustrating the contextual barriers to drinking cessation that need to be addressed through holistic approaches.

TI  - Delivery of sexual and reproductive health interventions in conflict settings: a systematic review
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Background It is essential to provide comprehensive sexual and reproductive health (SRH) interventions to women affected by armed conflict, but there is a lack of evidence on effective approaches to delivering such interventions in conflict settings. This review synthesised the available literature on SRH intervention delivery in conflict settings to inform potential priorities for further research and additional guidance development. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases using terms related to conflict, women and children, and SRH. We searched websites of 10 humanitarian organisations for relevant grey literature. Publications reporting on conflict-affected populations in low-income and middle-income countries and describing an SRH intervention delivered during or within 5 years after the end of a conflict were included. Information on population, intervention and delivery characteristics were extracted and narratively synthesised. Quantitative data on intervention coverage and effectiveness were tabulated, but no meta-analysis was undertaken. Results 110 publications met our eligibility criteria. Most focused on sub-Saharan Africa and displaced populations based in camps. Reported interventions targeted family planning, HIV/STIs, gender-based violence and general SRH. Most interventions were delivered in hospitals and clinics by doctors and nurses. Delivery barriers included security, population movement and lack of skilled health staff. Multistakeholder collaboration, community engagement and use of community and outreach workers were delivery facilitators. Reporting of intervention coverage or effectiveness data was limited. Discussion There is limited relevant literature on adolescents or out-of-camp populations and few publications reported on the use of existing guidance such as the Minimal Initial Services Package. More interventions for gender-based violence were reported in the grey than the indexed literature, suggesting limited formal research in this area. Engaging affected communities and using community-based sites and personnel are important, but more research is needed on how best to reach underserved populations and to implement community-based approaches.

TI  - From words to actions: systematic review of interventions to promote sexual and reproductive health of persons with disabilities in low- and middle-income countries
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction Persons with disabilities have the same sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) as non-disabled persons. Yet they face numerous barriers in their access to sexual and reproductive health services and their rights are often not met. Evidence on SRHR for persons with disabilities is sparse, particularly evaluations of interventions demonstrating 'what works.' This systematic review assessed interventions to promote SRHR for persons with disabilities in low- and middle-income countries. Methods We searched for qualitative, quantitative or mixed method observational studies representing primary research, published between 2010 and 2019, using MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Global Health and CINAHL Plus. Search strings were compiled for different elements of SRHR and for all forms of disability. 24,919 records were screened, leading to over 380 relevant papers, most of which were descriptive, focussing on needs and barriers to SRHR needs being fulfilled. Of the 33 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 18 were included in the synthesis. All included studies were assessed for bias and quality of evidence, using STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) and RATS (relevance, appropriateness, transparency andsoundness) tools. Among the 16 interventions (from 18 articles), 25% had low risk of bias, 31% had moderate risk of bias and 44% had high risk of bias. Data analysis used narrative synthesis; a method suited for systematic reviews with heterogeneous studies. We used Levesque healthcare access model to analyse the focus of interventions. Results 11 interventions were from upper middle-income settings; two from lower-income settings; only one operated in rural areas. Interventions addressed intellectual impairment (6), visual impairment (6), hearing impairment (4), mental health conditions (2) and physical impairments (2). Most interventions (15/16) focus on information provision and awareness raising. We could not identify any intervention promoting access to maternal health, family planning and contraception, or safe abortion for people with disabilities. Conclusion This systematic review has highlighted stark gaps in evidence. More rigorous evaluations are needed.

TI  - The availability of global guidance for the promotion of women's, newborns', children's and adolescents' health and nutrition in conflicts
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Background
   Significant global gains in sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and nutrition (SRMNCAH&N) will be difficult unless conflict settings are adequately addressed. We aimed to determine the amount, scope and quality of publically available guidance documents, to characterise the process by which agencies develop their guidance and to identify gaps in guidance on SRMNCAH&N promotion in conflicts.
   Methods
   We identified guidance documents published between 2008 and 2018 through English-language Internet sites of humanitarian response organisations, reviewed them for their scope and assessed their quality with the AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch and Evaluation II) tool. Additionally, we interviewed 22 key informants on guidance development, dissemination processes, perceived guidance gaps and applicability.
   Findings
   We identified 105 conflict-relevant guidance documents from 75 organisations. Of these, nine were specific to conflicts, others were applicable also to other humanitarian settings. Fifteen documents were technical normative guidelines, others were operational guides (67), descriptive documents (21) or advice on legal, human rights or ethics questions (2). Nutrition was the most addressed health topic, followed by communicable diseases and violence. The documents rated high quality in their 'scope and purpose' and 'clarity of presentation' and low for 'rigour of development' and 'editorial independence'. Key informants reported end user need as the primary driver for guideline development and WHO technical guidelines as their main evidence base. Insufficient local contextualisation, lack of inter-agency coordination and lack of systematic implementation were considered problems in guideline development. Several guidance gaps were noted, including abortion care, newborn care, early child development, mental health, adolescent health beyond sexual and reproductive health and non-communicable diseases.
   Interpretation
   Organisations are motivated and actively producing guidance for SRMNCAH&N promotion in humanitarian settings, but few documents address conflicts specifically and there are important guidance gaps. Improved inter-organisation collaboration for guidance on SRMNCAH&N promotion in conflicts and other humanitarian settings is needed.

TI  - Predictors of female sexual dysfunction: a systematic review and qualitative analysis through gender inequality paradigms
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background: Female sexual dysfunction affects 41% of reproductive-age women worldwide, making it a highly prevalent medical issue. Predictors of female sexual dysfunction are multifaceted and vary from country to country. A synthesis of potential risk factors and protective factors may aid healthcare practitioners in identifying populations at risk, in addition to revealing modifiable factors to prevent sexual dysfunction among reproductive-age women.
   Methods: Observational studies which assessed the prevalence and predictors of female sexual dysfunction in reproductive-age women were systematically sought in relevant databases (2000-2014). Significant predictors were extracted from each included publication. A qualitative analysis of predictors was performed with a focus on types of sexual regimes and level of human development.
   Results: One hundred thirty-five studies from 41 countries were included in the systematic review. The types of predictors varied according to the location of the study, the type of sexual regime and the level of gender inequality in that country/region. Consistently significant risk factors of female sexual dysfunction were: poor physical health, poor mental health, stress, abortion, genitourinary problems, female genital mutilation, relationship dissatisfaction, sexual abuse, and being religious. Consistently significant protective factors included: older age at marriage, exercising, daily affection, intimate communication, having a positive body image, and sex education. Some factors however had an unclear effect: age, education, employment, parity, being in a relationship, frequency of sexual intercourse, race, alcohol consumption, smoking and masturbation.
   Conclusions: The sexual and reproductive lives of women are highly impacted by female sexual dysfunction, and a number of biological, psychological and social factors play a role in the prevalence of sexual dysfunction. Healthcare professionals who work with women should be aware of the many risk factors for reproductive-age women. Future prevention strategies should aim to address modifiable factors, e.g. physical activity and access to sex education; international efforts in empowering women should continue.

TI  - Associations between Intimate Partner Violence and Termination of Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - PLOS MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) and termination of pregnancy (TOP) are global health concerns, but their interaction is undetermined. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between IPV and TOP.
   Methods and Findings: A systematic review based on a search of Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Ovid Maternity and Infant Care from each database's inception to 21 September 2013 for peer-reviewed articles of any design and language found 74 studies regarding women who had undergone TOP and had experienced at least one domain (physical, sexual, or emotional) of IPV. Prevalence of IPV and association between IPV and TOP were meta-analysed. Sample sizes ranged from eight to 33,385 participants. Worldwide, rates of IPV in the preceding year in women undergoing TOP ranged from 2.5% to 30%. Lifetime prevalence by meta-analysis was shown to be 24.9% (95% CI 19.9% to 30.6%); heterogeneity was high (I-2 > 90%), and variation was not explained by study design, quality, or size, or country gross national income per capita. IPV, including history of rape, sexual assault, contraceptive sabotage, and coerced decision-making, was associated with TOP, and with repeat TOPs. By meta-analysis, partner not knowing about the TOP was shown to be significantly associated with IPV (pooled odds ratio 2.97, 95% CI 2.39 to 3.69). Women in violent relationships were more likely to have concealed the TOP from their partner than those who were not. Demographic factors including age, ethnicity, education, marital status, income, employment, and drug and alcohol use showed no strong or consistent mediating effect. Few long-term outcomes were studied. Women welcomed the opportunity to disclose IPV and be offered help. Limitations include study heterogeneity, potential underreporting of both IPV and TOP in primary data sources, and inherent difficulties in validation.
   Conclusions: IPV is associated with TOP. Novel public health approaches are required to prevent IPV. TOP services provide an opportune health-based setting to design and test interventions.

TI  - Magnitude of Unintended Pregnancy and Associated Factors Among Pregnant Women in Debre Markos Town, East Gojjam Zone, Northwest Ethiopia: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background: Unintended pregnancy is an important public health concern in both developing and developed countries due to its serious consequences for women, infants, families and communities, including the risk of unsafe abortion, delayed prenatal care, poor maternal mental health, poor child health outcomes and unemployment.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of unintended pregnancy among pregnant women in the town of Debre Markos in 2019.
   Methods: The magnitude and associated factors of unintended pregnancy were assessed using a community-based cross-sectional study design. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select five Kebeles (basic administrative units), and households were selected from the selected Kebeles using simple random sampling. A total of 580 samples were collected through standardized pretested questionnaires. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the relationship between the UP and independent variables.
   Results: Of the pregnant women, 202 (34.8%) (95% CI: 30.9-38.7) participants had an unintended current pregnancy; of those 144 (24.8%) were mistimed pregnancies. Women aged 24 years were three times more likely to have an unintended pregnancy than those aged 35 years. Divorced and widowed women were four times more likely than women who were currently married to experience an unintended pregnancy Gravidity 1-2 and 3-4 were 94% and 86% less likely than gravidity > 5 to experience an unintended pregnancy, and women who made family planning decisions on their own were less likely to have an unintended pregnancy.
   Conclusion: According to this study, the prevalence of unintended pregnancy was 34.8% and unintended pregnancy was significantly correlated with women's age, marital status, gravidity and who made decisions on family planning. There is an obvious need to devise communication strategies on fertility and contraceptive issues between couples through peer education, and to encourage correct use of long-acting modern methods of family planning.

TI  - Study of the factors associated with the delay of health consultation of victims of rape in Senegal
T2  - REVUE D EPIDEMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
AB  - Introduction. - Rape remains one of the most serious forms of sexual violence because of its negative impact on the physical and mental health of victims. The objective of this study is to identify the factors associated with the delay in rape victims seeking medical assistance from healthcare professionals in Senegal.
   Methodology. - A retrospective, descriptive and analytical observation study was conducted. The study population consisted of all the court files of girls or women victims of rape recorded by the investigators at the 11 high courts of Senegal during the period from 2006 to 2015. An exhaustive recruitment of the full records of rape victims meeting the inclusion criteria were completed. The uni and multivariate analyses were carried out with Epi Info 2000 and R 2.2.9 software respectively.
   Results. - At the end of the collection, 1,037 cases of rape were included in the study population. The average age of the victims was 16.3 +/- 7.9 years (range 1-72). Minors ( < 18 years) accounted for 24.8 %. The median time from rape to consultation at a health facility was 24 hours. Long delay in consultation ( > 24 hours) was noted for 38.6 % of victims. Risk of late consultation after rape was higher among victims residing in the southern areas (ORaj = 4.31 [1.15-16.141), or northern areas (ORaj = 4.22 [1.26-14.141), who were major (ORaj = 1.67 [1.04-2.681) or married (ORaj = 3.44 [1.58-7.51) or who were pregnant after the aggression (ORaj = 34.03 [15.47-74.851) or had an abortion (ORaj = 5.45 [1.04-24.47]).
   Conclusion. - Medical and judicial assistance are more difficult if there is a long delay between the aggression and consultation. Thus, it is important for the health and judicial authorities to raise awareness about the harmful consequences of sexual violence, and to put forward the benefits of therapeutic care, compensation for the harm suffered by rape victims, as well as the availability of holistic care services 24 hours a day.

TI  - Miscarriage matters: the epidemiological, physical, psychological, and economic costs of early pregnancy loss
T2  - LANCET
AB  - Miscarriage is generally defined as the loss of a pregnancy before viability. An estimated 23 million miscarriages occur every year worldwide, translating to 44 pregnancy losses each minute. The pooled risk of miscarriage is 15.3% (95% CI 12.5-18.7%) of all recognised pregnancies. The population prevalence of women who have had one miscarriage is 10.8% (10.3-11.4%), two miscarriages is 1.9% (1.8-2.1%), and three or more miscarriages is 0.7% (0.5-0.8%). Risk factors for miscarriage include very young or older female age (younger than 20 years and older than 35 years), older male age (older than 40 years), very low or very high body-mass index, Black ethnicity, previous miscarriages, smoking, alcohol, stress, working night shifts, air pollution, and exposure to pesticides. The consequences of miscarriage are both physical, such as bleeding or infection, and psychological. Psychological consequences include increases in the risk of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide. Miscarriage, and especially recurrent miscarriage, is also a sentinel risk marker for obstetric complications, including preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, and stillbirth in future pregnancies, and a predictor of longer-term health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolism. The costs of miscarriage affect individuals, health-care systems, and society. The short-term national economic cost of miscarriage is estimated to be 471 pound million per year in the UK. As recurrent miscarriage is a sentinel marker for various obstetric risks in future pregnancies, women should receive care in preconception and obstetric clinics specialising in patients at high risk. As psychological morbidity is common after pregnancy loss, effective screening instruments and treatment options for mental health consequences of miscarriage need to be available. We recommend that miscarriage data are gathered and reported to facilitate comparison of rates among countries, to accelerate research, and to improve patient care and policy development.

TI  - Health consequences of domestic violence against women in Serbia
T2  - VOJNOSANITETSKI PREGLED
AB  - Background/Aim. Domestic violence against women is a significant public health problem resulting in serious health and social consequences, for women and their families. The aim of this study was to analyze the sociodemographic characteristic of women who were exposed to domestic violence, as well as the impact of violence on women's health. Methods. Data from cross-sectional study from the 2013 National Health Survey in Serbia were used analyzing 6,320 women aged 20-75 years. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were implemented to assess the association of exposure to domestic violence against women with sociodemographic characteristics, as well as with selected health indicators and health risk behaviors. Results. Out of total number of examined women, 307 (4.9%) reported that they experienced physical and/or psychological violence in the last 12 months. Divorced or separated women, poor women and women with poor social support had greater odds for exposure to domestic violence. Women who had experienced domestic violence were less likely to perceived their health as good than women who had not experienced domestic violence [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.32-0.71], and more likely to report severe or very severe pain (AOR = 2.41; 95% CI = 1.74-3.33), stress and pressure exposure (AOR = 2.62; 95% CI = 1.89-3.64) and depression (AOR = 3.24; 95% CI = 2.08-5.03). Exposure to violence was also associated with the use of sleeping pills or sedative (AOR = 2.21; 95% CI = 1.67-2.93), with frequent use of alcohol (AOR = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.08-1.86) and abortion (AOR = 3.11; 95% CI = 1.48-6.54). Conclusion. Women, victims of domestic violence are more likely to have physical and mental disorders compared to women who are not victims of domestic violence. Violence prevention demands a multi-sectoral approach, in which the health sector has a central role that includes early identification and recognition of abuse, appropriate care as well as documenting and reporting violence.

TI  - Perceived stress and associated factors among pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic period in Northwest Ethiopia, 2020: a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of perceived stress among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Northwest Ethiopia. Method A cross-sectional study. Setting University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia. Participants A total of 415 pregnant women were recruited by using a systematic random sampling technique from 28 April 2020 to 12 June 2020. Measurement The required data were collected through face-to-face interviews. The Perceived Stress Scale was used to assess perceived stress. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Oslo Social Support Scale 3 were used for associated factors. The data were analysed by using SPSS V.20. We also included sociodemographic, obstetrical and gynaecology, substance use and intimate partner-related factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify associated factors with perceived stress. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify the effect of each independent variable with the outcome variable. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results A total of 415 pregnant women participated in the study with response rate of 98.57%. The prevalence of perceived stress is found to be 13.7% (95% CI=10.4% to 17.1%). According to the multivariable logistic regression result, being a student (adjusted OR (AOR)=9.67, 95% CI=2.739 to 34.183), being at the first and third trimesters of gestational age (AOR=3.56, 95% CI=1.065 to 11.885; AOR=4.80, 95% CI=1.851 to 14.479, respectively), and having antenatal depression (AOR=3.51, 95% CI=1.628 to 7.563) were factors positively associated with perceived stress. Conclusion The prevalence of perceived stress among pregnant people was relatively high. This study recommends that all pregnant people should be screened and treated for perceived stress particularly during the first and third trimesters. Emphasis should be given to early detection and treatment of antenatal depression. Pregnant students must be strongly evaluated and intervened for perceived stress.

TI  - Increased risk of multiple pregnancy complications following large-scale power outages during Hurricane Sandy in New York State
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Background: Large-scale power outages (PO) are increasing in the context of climate change. Although some research has been conducted into the adverse health impacts of POs, significant gaps remain regarding whether POs would affect the health of pregnant women. We investigated the association between ED visits due to pregnancy complications and the occurence, intensity, and duration of large-scale POs in eight Sandy-affected counties in New York State (NYS).
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, daily ED visits for pregnancy complications and large-scale POdata in eight counties in NYS from October to December in 2005-2014 were collected. Using time-series analysis, we estimated the relative increase in ED visits for pregnancy complications during POs compared with non-PO periods at lag 0-7 days. Short-term health impacts of PO intensity and PO duration were investigated. Estimations were also stratified by sociodemographic characteristics and disease subtypes including threatened or spontaneous abortion, threatened or early labor, hypertension complications, infections of genitourinary tract, renal diseases, gestational diabetes mellitus, mental illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy.
   Results: From October to December in 2005-2014, there were 307,739 ED visits for pregnancy complications in the eight counties. We found significant increases in ED visits for overall pregnancy complications (16.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.3%, 23.2%) during the Hurricane-PO period at lag 0-7 days. The ED visits increased by 8.8% per level increase in PO intensity and 1.4% per day increase in PO duration. Specifically, threatened/ early delivery and gestational diabetes mellitus during the PO period increased by 26.7% (95% CI: 8.2%, 48.4%) and 111.8% (95% CI: 16.7%, 284.4%), respectively. Young adult, Black, Hispanic, and uninsured individuals were at higher risk of complications.
   Conclusions: POs may adversely impact pregnancy, especially for certain pregnancy complications and among low sociodemographic women. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Factors affecting the emotional wellbeing of women and men who experience miscarriage in hospital settings: a scoping review
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB  - Background Miscarriage can be a devastating event for women and men that can lead to short- and long-term emotional distress. Studies have reported associations between miscarriage and depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder in women. Men can also experience intense grief and sadness following their partner's miscarriage. While numerous studies have reported hospital-related factors impacting the emotional wellbeing of parents experiencing miscarriage, there is a lack of review evidence which synthesises the findings of current research. Aims The aim of this review was to synthesise the findings of studies of emotional distress and wellbeing among women and men experiencing miscarriage in hospital settings. Methods A systematic search of the literature was conducted in October 2020 across three different databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE and PsycInfo) and relevant charity organisation websites, Google, and OpenGrey. A Mixed Methods appraisal tool (MMAT) and AACODS checklist were used to assess the quality of primary studies. Results Thirty studies were included in this review representing qualitative (N = 21), quantitative (N = 7), and mixed-methods (N = 2) research from eleven countries. Findings indicated that women and men's emotional wellbeing is influenced by interactions with health professionals, provision of information, and the hospital environment. Parents' experiences in hospitals were characterised by a perceived lack of understanding among healthcare professionals of the significance of their loss and emotional support required. Parents reported that their distress was exacerbated by a lack of information, support, and feelings of isolation in the aftermath of miscarriage. Further, concerns were expressed about the hospital environment, in particular the lack of privacy. Conclusion Women and men are dissatisfied with the emotional support received in hospital settings and describe a number of hospital-related factors as exacerbators of emotional distress. Implications for practice This review highlights the need for hospitals to take evidence-informed action to improve emotional support services for people experiencing miscarriage within their services.

TI  - Exploring the needs of parents who experience miscarriage in the emergency department: A qualitative study with parents and nurses
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
AB  - Aims and objectivesTo understand how parents experienced miscarriage in an emergency department setting. Objectives were to identify parents' needs, isolate factors that influenced their experience, and provide recommendations to improve care from the perspective of women, their partners, nurses and nurse managers.
   BackgroundMiscarriage is the most prevalent complication encountered during pregnancy. It subjects parents to a multitude of emotions and may have significant consequences on mental health. Emergency department visits are frequently the only opportunity for parents to receive formal support during a miscarriage; it is thus crucial to understand the experiences of parents in this setting.
   DesignThe study employed a descriptive, exploratory, qualitative approach with semi-structured interviews.
   MethodsThe study was founded on the W.K. Kellogg Foundation's Logic Model Development Guide (2004) and Meleis' Transitions Theory (2015). A total of 26 participants were interviewed (17 parents, 7 emergency department nurses and 2 emergency department nurse managers). Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research was used to report results.
   ResultsThree categories of needs were identified: physical health, cognitive and emotional. For instance, parents expressed a need to receive more information during their visit to the emergency department (i.e., a cognitive need), whether about the diagnostic test results or how to ensure a better recovery. Parents also reported a desire for professionals to address their emotional concerns. Nurses were aware of the emotional impact of miscarriage but felt that they were not adequately trained in providing optimal care to parents in this situation.
   ConclusionsParents who visited the emergency department for miscarriage reported several unfulfilled needs that generated dissatisfaction with care. Emergency department organisational constraints hindered optimal nursing care practices.
   Relevance to clinical practiceNurses have an important role to play in improving parents' experience. They can do so by understanding the needs of parents and by being involved in developing new guidelines.

TI  - Something must happen before first breath
T2  - BMC MEDICAL ETHICS
AB  - Background Definition and concept of the 'beginning of human life' are weakened by co-existing contrasting hypotheses based on humanistic or religious beliefs rather than scientific foundations. This plethora of conceptually distant views have important common concerns in different fields of science and shape, in turn, several societal aspects including laws related, for instance, to inheritance eligibility or abortion, end-of-life care and euthanasia, and reproductive technology. Also, they are fundamental to evaluate opportunity for resuscitation vs. palliative care in extremely preterm infants. In this article, we address one of the most common tenets in medicine: the acceptance that human life starts with first breath, even though several events are well-documented to take place before its occurrence. Main text Several studies show how pivotal physiological events take place before first breath. Evidence of a number of neurological events occurring before first breath opens the way to the primacy of the Central Nervous System, given its immediate extra-uterine activation at birth. This activation eventually sets specific physiological conditions that allow the complex sequence of events determining the muscle activity associated with the influx of air in the lung and the settling of a continuous and successful extra-uterine respiration. We would like to invite the scientific community to endorse a clear-cut position against the paradigm of 'first breath' as the beginning of life. Herein, we also assume how, a still undefined, yet possibly specific quid in the external environment triggers further physiological response in newborns. Better understanding of the critical events that occur at the beginning of human life is likely to cause great concern and expectations in scientists, researchers and physicians working in the domain of brain, and its physiology, and mental health. Conclusions The comparison between beliefs and evidence-based observations generates confusion, misperceptions and false expectations in society, hence, in the scientific and medical community. Different and more solid alternatives about the carachterization of the 'beginning of human life' are indeed available and require to be explored and defined.

TI  - Randomised preference trial of medical versus surgical termination of pregnancy less than 14 weeks' gestation (TOPS)
T2  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
AB  - Objectives:To determine the acceptability, efficacy and costs of medical termination of pregnancy (MTOP) compared with surgical termination of pregnancy (STOP) at less than 14 weeks' gestation, and to understand women's decision-making processes and experiences when accessing the termination service.
   Design:A partially randomised preference trial and economic evaluation with follow-up at 2 weeks and 3 months.
   Setting:The Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.
   Participants:Women accepted for termination of pregnancy (TOP) under the relevant Acts of Parliament with pregnancies < 14 weeks' gestation on the day of abortion. A further group of women attending contraception and sexual health clinics participated in a discrete choice experiment (DCE).
   Interventions: STOP: all women >= 6 weeks' and < 14 weeks' gestation were primed with misoprostol 400 mu g 2 hours before the procedure. STOP was performed under general anaesthesia using vacuum aspiration. MTOP: all women < 14 weeks' gestation were given mifepristone 200 mg orally, returning 36-48 hours later for misoprostol.
   Outcome measures: Main outcome measure was acceptability of TOP method. Secondary outcome measures included strength of preference by willingness to pay (WTP); distress, using the Impact of Event Scale (IES); anxiety and depression; satisfaction with care; experience of care; frequency and extent of symptoms including self-assessment of pain; clinical effectiveness; and complications. A DCE was used to identify attributes that shape women's preferences for abortion services.
   Results:The trial recruited 1877 women, 349 in the randomised arms and 1528 in the preference arms. Of those in the preference arms, 54% chose MTOP. At 2 weeks after the procedure more women having STOP would choose the same method again in the future. Acceptability of MTOP declined with increasing gestational age. The difference in acceptability between STOP and MTOP persisted at 3 months. At 2 weeks after TOP, women in the preference arms were prepared to pay more to have their preferred option. There was no difference in anxiety or depression scores in women having MTOP or STOP. However, women randomised to MTOP had higher scores on subscales of the IES at both 2 weeks and 3 months. There was no difference in IES scores between MTOP and STOP in the preference arm. Women were more likely to be satisfied overall and with technical and interpersonal aspects of care if they had STOP rather than MTOP. Experience of care scores were lower after MTOP in both randomised and preference arms. During admission women undergoing MTOP had more symptoms and reported higher mean pain scores, and after discharge reported more nausea and diarrhoea. There were no differences in time taken to return to work between groups; around 90% had returned to work and normal activity by 2 weeks. Rates of unplanned or emergency admissions were higher after MTOP than after STOP Overall complication rates were also higher after MTOP, although this only achieved statistical significance in the preference arm. Overall, STOP cost more than MTOP due to higher inpatient standard costs. Even though complication rates were higher with MTOP, it was still more cost-effective. DCE identified three attributes with an almost equal impact on women's preferences: provision of counselling, number of days delay to the procedure, and possibility of an overnight stay.
   Conclusions: MTOP was associated with more negative experiences of care and lower acceptability Acceptability of MTOP declined with increasing gestational age. MTOP was less costly but also less effective than STOP. The majority of women choosing MTOP were satisfied with their care and found the procedure acceptable.
   Recommendations for further research: An audit of provision of MTOP and STOP in England and Wales is urgently required. Further studies exploring the barriers to offering women the choice of method of TOP are needed, together with research on the acceptability and effectiveness of (1) MTOP and manual VA in pregnancies below 9 weeks' gestation and (2) MTOP and dilatation and evacuation after 14 weeks' gestation.

TI  - Prospectively assessed perceived stress associated with early pregnancy losses among women with history of pregnancy loss
T2  - HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB  - STUDY QUESTION What is the association between perceived stress during peri-conception and early pregnancy and pregnancy loss among women who have experienced a prior pregnancy loss? SUMMARY ANSWER Daily perceived stress above the median is associated with over a 2-fold risk of early pregnancy loss among women who have experienced a prior loss. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY? Women who have experienced a pregnancy loss may be more vulnerable to stress while trying to become pregnant again. While prior research has indicated a link between psychological stress and clinically confirmed miscarriages, research is lacking among a pre-conceptional cohort followed prospectively for the effects of perceived stress during early critical windows of pregnancy establishment on risk of both hCG-detected pregnancy losses and confirmed losses, while considering important time-varying confounders. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Secondary data analysis of the EAGeR trial (2007-2011) among women with an hCG-detected pregnancy (n = 797 women). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Women from four US clinical centers enrolled pre-conceptionally and were followed <= 6 cycles while attempting pregnancy and, as applicable, throughout pregnancy. Perceived stress was captured via daily diaries and end-of-month questionnaires. Main outcome measures include hCG-detected and clinically recognized pregnancy losses. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Among women who had an hCG-confirmed pregnancy, 188 pregnancies (23.6%) ended in loss. Women with high (>50th percentile) versus low (<= 50th percentile) peri-implantation or early pregnancy weekly perceived stress had an elevated risk of experiencing any pregnancy loss (hazard ratio (HR): 1.69, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.54) or clinical loss (HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 0.96, 2.60), with higher risks observed for women experiencing an hCG-detected loss (HR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.04, 4.46). Models accounted for women's age, BMI, employment, marital status, income, education, race, parity, prior losses, exercise and time-varying nausea/vomiting, caffeine, alcohol and smoking. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION We were limited in our ability to clearly identify the mechanisms of stress on pregnancy loss due to our sole reliance on self-reported perceived stress, and the lack of biomarkers of different pathways of stress. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS This study provides new insight on early pregnancy perceived stress and risk of pregnancy loss, most notably hCG-detected losses, among women with a history of a prior loss. Our study is an improvement over past studies in its ability to account for time-varying early pregnancy symptoms, such as nausea/vomiting, and lifestyle factors, such as caffeine, alcohol and smoking, which are also risk factors for psychological stress and pregnancy loss.

TI  - Behavior Change Around an Online Health Awareness Campaign: A Causal Impact Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - National Eating Disorders Association conducts a NEDAwareness week every year, during which it publishes content on social media and news aimed to raise awareness of eating disorders. Measuring the impact of these actions is vital for maximizing the effectiveness of such interventions. This study is an effort to empirically measure the change in behavior of users who engage with NEDAwareness content, and compare the detected changes between campaigns in two different years. We analyze a total of 35,895 tweets generated during two campaigns of NEDAwareness campaigns in 2019 and 2020. In order to assess the reach of each campaign, we consider the users participating in the campaigns and their number of followers, as well as retweeting engagement. We use the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text modeling and causal impact analysis in order to gauge the change in self-expression of users who have interacted with the NEDAwareness content, compared to a baseline group of users. We further enrich our understanding of the users by extracting gender information from their display names. We find that, despite large media corporations (such as MTV and Teen Vogue) participating in the campaign, it is governmental and nonprofit accounts who are among the accounts that attract the most retweets. Whereas the most influential accounts were well-connected in 2019, the 2020 campaign saw little retweeting between such accounts, negatively impacting the reach of the material. Both campaigns engaged women at around 40% and men 17%, supporting previous research showing women to be more likely to share their experiences with eating disorders. Further, women were more likely to mention other health topics within the 15 days of the intervention, including pregnancy and abortion, as well as depression and anxiety, and to discuss the developing COVID pandemic in 2020. Despite the positive message of the campaign, we find that the users who have engaged with this content were more likely to mention the linguistic categories concerning anxiety and risk. Thus, we illustrate the complex, gender-specific effects of NEDAwareness online health intervention campaign on the continued self-expression of its audience and provide actionable insights for potential improvement of such public health efforts.

TI  - Determinants of unintended pregnancies in rural Ghana
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB  - Background: Unintended pregnancies may carry serious consequences for women and their families, including the possibility of unsafe abortion, delayed prenatal care, poor maternal mental health and poor child health outcomes. Although between 1993 and 2008, unintended births decreased from 42% to 37% in Ghana, the rate of decline is low, whilst levels are still very high. This raises the need to understand factors associated with unintended pregnancies, especially among women in rural settings where the rates and risks are highest to help improve maternal health.
   Method: We collected data from 1,914 pregnant women attending antenatal clinic between January 2012 and April 2012 in four health facilities in the Mfantseman Municipal of the Central Region of Ghana. We used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to explore how socio-demographic characteristics, past reproductive health experiences, partner characteristics and relations, awareness and past experience with contraceptives, influenced the status of women's current pregnancy (whether intended or unintended).
   Results: The mean age of the 1,914 respondents in this study was 25.6 +/- 6.5 years. Seventy percent (70%) said the pregnancies they were carrying were unintended. The odds of carrying unintended pregnancy among women with five or more children were higher than those with one to two children [AOR 6.06, 95% CI (3.24-11.38) versus AOR 1.48, 95% CI (1.14-1.93)]. Women with other marital arrangements showed significantly higher odds of carrying unintended pregnancy compared to those married by ordinance (Muslim or Christian wedding). Women not living with their partners exhibited increased odds of having unintended pregnancies compared to women who lived with their partners (AOR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.28-2.30). Awareness of traditional methods of family planning (withdrawal and rhythm) was associated with lower odds of having unintended pregnancy compared to non-awareness (AOR 0.66, 95% CI (0.49-0.89).
   Conclusions: In this study, important risk factors associated with unintended pregnancies were: parity, living arrangements with partner, marriage by ordinance and awareness of traditional, non-pharmacological contraceptive methods. Family planning interventions targeting different groups of women, especially during the postpartum period, would be essential to reduce rates of unintended pregnancies and promote positive health outcomes.

TI  - Health consequences of exposure to e-waste: a systematic review
T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Background The population exposed to potentially hazardous substances through inappropriate and unsafe management practices related to disposal and recycling of end-of-life electrical and electronic equipment, collectively known as e-waste, is increasing. We aimed to summarise the evidence for the association between such exposures and adverse health outcomes.
   Methods We systematically searched five electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycNET, and CINAHL) for studies assessing the association between exposure to e-waste and outcomes related to mental health and neurodevelopment, physical health, education, and violence and criminal behaviour, from Jan 1, 1965, to Dec 17, 2012, and yielded 2274 records. Of the 165 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, we excluded a further 142, resulting in the inclusion of 23 published epidemiological studies that met the predetermined criteria. All studies were from southeast China. We assessed evidence of a causal association between exposure to e-waste and health outcomes within the Bradford Hill framework.
   Findings We recorded plausible outcomes associated with exposure to e-waste including change in thyroid function, changes in cellular expression and function, adverse neonatal outcomes, changes in temperament and behaviour, and decreased lung function. Boys aged 8-9 years living in an e-waste recycling town had a lower forced vital capacity than did those living in a control town. Significant negative correlations between blood chromium concentrations and forced vital capacity in children aged 11 and 13 years were also reported. Findings from most studies showed increases in spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and premature births, and reduced birthweights and birth lengths associated with exposure to e-waste. People living in e-waste recycling towns or working in e-waste recycling had evidence of greater DNA damage than did those living in control towns. Studies of the effects of exposure to e-waste on thyroid function were not consistent. One study related exposure to e-waste and waste electrical and electronic equipment to educational outcomes.
   Interpretation Although data suggest that exposure to e-waste is harmful to health, more well designed epidemiological investigations in vulnerable populations, especially pregnant women and children, are needed to confirm these associations.

TI  - Comorbidity of hospital-treated psychiatric and physical disorders with special reference to schizophrenia: a 28 year follow-up of the 1966 Northern Finland general population birth cohort
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - We studied the comorbidity of psychiatric and physical disorders in a sample (n = 11 017) from the unselected, general population, Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort. During the period 1982-1994, hospital-treated psychiatric patients were more likely than people without psychiatric diagnoses to have been treated for physical disease in hospital wards, 298 out of 387 (77.0%) vs 6687 out of 10 630 (62.9%) (OR=2.0, 95% CI=1.6-2.5). Injuries, poisonings and indefinite symptoms were a more common reason for hospital treatment in people with schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorder as compared with people without a psychiatric disorder. Men with psychiatric disorder had more than a 50-fold risk for poisoning by psychotropic drugs (OR = 52.6, 95% CI = 27.7-99.8), women with psychiatric disorder a 20-fold risk (OR = 19.0, 95% CI = 9.5-38.1) and schizophrenics more than a 30-fold risk (OR = 37.5, 95% CI = 19.1-73.8). Men with psychiatric disorders were more commonly hospitalised for a variety of gastrointestinal disorders and circulatory diseases (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.2-4.4), as compared with men with no psychiatric disorder. Respiratory diseases (OR=2.2, 95% CI=1.2-4.2), vertebral column disorders (OR=4.2, 95% CI=1.8-9.9), gynaecological disorders (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.2-3.6) and induced abortions (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.2-2.7) were more prevalent in women with psychiatric disorder than in other women. Epilepsy was strongly associated with schizophrenia (OR=11.1, 95% CI=4.0-31.6). Nervous and sensory organ diseases in general (OR=2.5, 95% CI = 1.1-5.8) and inflammatory diseases of the bowel (OR = 12.8, 95% CI = 3.8-42.7) were also overrepresented in schizophrenia when compared with people without a psychiatric disorder. Our results indicate that physicians must be alert for psychiatric disorder, and mental health professionals must be aware of the considerable physical morbidity in their patients.

TI  - Postpartum depressive symptoms in the context of high social adversity and reproductive health threats: a population-based study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS
AB  - Background: Postpartum depression is an important but neglected public health issue in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to assess postpartum depressive (PPD) symptoms and associated factors in a rural Ethiopian setting characterized by high social adversity and reproductive health threats. We hypothesized that infant gender preference would be associated with PPD symptoms.
   Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted in Sodo district, southern Ethiopia, between March and June 2014. A total of 3147 postpartum women (one to 12 months after delivery) were recruited and interviewed in their homes. The questionnaire included demographic, reproductive health and psychosocial factors in addition to a culturally validated measure of depressive symptoms, the Patient Health Questionnaire. Scores of 5 or more were indicative of high levels of PPD symptoms.
   Results: The prevalence of high PPD symptoms was 12.2%, with 95% confidence interval (CI) between 11.1 and 13.4. Of these, 12.0% of the study participants had suicidal ideation. Preference of the husband for a boy baby was associated with PPD symptoms in univariate analysis (crude odds ratio 1.43: 95% CI 1.04, 1.91) but became non-significant after adjusting for confounders. In the final multivariable analysis, rural residence [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.56: 95% CI 2.56, 4.19], grand multiparity (aOR 2.00: 1.22, 3.26), perinatal complications (aOR: 2.55: 1.89, 3.44), a past history of abortion (aOR 1.50: 1.07, 2.11), experiencing hunger in the preceding 1 month (aOR 2.38: 1.75, 3.23), lower perceived wealth (aOR 2.11: 1.19, 3.76), poor marital relationship (aOR 2.47: 1.79, 3.42), and one or more stressful events in the preceding 6 months (aOR 2.36: 1.82, 3.06) were associated significantly with high PPD symptoms.
   Conclusion: PPD symptoms affected more than one in 10 women in this Ethiopian community setting. Social adversity and reproductive health threats were associated with poorer mental health. Interventions focusing on poor rural women with low access to care are necessary. This research can serve as an entry point for the adaptation of a psychosocial intervention.

TI  - Cat-dependent diseases cost Australia AU$6 billion per year through impacts on human health and livestock production
T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
AB  - Context. Cats are the definitive or primary host for pathogens that cause diseases in people and livestock. These cat-dependent diseases would not occur in Australia if cats had not been introduced, and their ongoing persistence depends on contacts with cats. Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that cycles between cats and any other warm-blooded animals. People infected by T. gondii may appear asymptomatic, or have a mild illness, or experience severe, potentially lethal symptoms; the parasite may also affect behaviour and mental health. T. gondii is also a major contributor to spontaneous abortion in sheep and goats. Two species of Sarcocystis, another genus of protozoan parasite, cycle through cats and sheep, causing macroscopic cysts to form in sheep tissues that reduce meat saleability. Toxocara cati, the cat roundworm, causes minor illnesses in humans and livestock, and the bacterium Bartonella henselae causes cat scratch disease, an infection that can be contracted by people when scratched or bitten by cats carrying the pathogen.
   Aims. We estimated the economic costs of cat-dependent pathogens in Australia.
   Methods. We collated national and global data on infection rates, health and production consequences.
   Key results. We estimated the costs of two cat-dependent diseases (toxoplasmosis, cat scratch disease) in people at AU $6.06 billion (plausible range AU$2.11-10.7 billion) annually, and the costs to livestock production from toxoplasmosis and sarcocystosis at AU$11.7 million (plausible range AU$7.67-18.3 million). Most of the human health costs are due to the associations between T. gondii and higher rates of traffic accidents and mental illness in people. The causality behind these associations remains uncertain, so those costs may be overestimated. Conversely, our estimates are incomplete, infections and illness are under-reported or misdiagnosed, and our understanding of disease outcomes is still imperfect, all of which make our costs underestimated.
   Conclusions. Our analysis suggests that substantial benefits to public health and livestock production could be realised by reducing exposure to cats and breaking parasite transmission cycles.
   Implications. Reducing feral cat populations in farming and urban areas, reducing the pet cat population and increasing rates of pet cat containment could help reduce the burden of cat-dependent diseases to people and livestock.

TI  - Reproduction, fear of childbirth and obstetric outcomes in women treated for fear of childbirth in their first pregnancy: A historical cohort
T2  - ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Introduction About 8% of the pregnant women in Sweden receive counseling for fear of childbirth (FOC) during pregnancy. Little is known about the long-term reproductive and obstetric outcomes after counseling for FOC: Therefore, the objective of this historical cohort study was to compare the long-term reproductive and obstetric outcomes in women treated for FOC in their first pregnancy to women without FOC. Material and methods All nulliparas consecutively referred for treatment of severe FOC between 2001 and 2007 (n = 608) were compared with all other nulliparas giving birth on the same day (n = 431). Women who were not fluent in Swedish, missing a postal address, had moved out of the area, given birth at another hospital or had a late spontaneous abortion were excluded (n = 555). A total of 235 women agreed to participate in the study, 63 (39%) women in the index group and 172 (53%) in the reference group. The women were contacted by letter in 2015, ie 7-14 years after first childbirth, and asked to permit access to their medical charts from pregnancies and childbirths and to fill out a study specific questionnaire. Based on data from the medical charts and questionnaire, the mode of delivery, birth experience, obstetric complications, FOC, counseling for FOC and number of childbirths were compared in the two groups. Results Women in the index group less often gave birth more than twice compared with the reference group (8.2% vs 22.0%, P = 0.012). We found no significant differences in complications during subsequent pregnancies and deliveries. Women in the index group more often gave birth by CS in their first (P = 0.002) and second childbirth (P = 0.001), more often had a less positive birth experience (index group NRS: median 6.0, interquartile range 6 vs reference group NRS: 7.0, interquartile range 5, P = 0.004) in their first delivery and more often received counseling for FOC (58.7% vs 12.5%, P < 0.001) in subsequent pregnancies. Women in the index group more often experienced FOC (18% vs 5.3%, P = 0.001) 7-14 years after first childbirth. Conclusions FOC is not easily treated. Despite treatment and exposure to childbirth many women received treatment in their next pregnancy and still suffered from FOC 7-14 years after the first childbirth.

TI  - Prevalence and health outcomes of domestic violence amongst clinical populations in Arab countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: An estimated 30% of women worldwide experience intimate partner violence (IPV) during their lifetime. Exposure to IPV is associated with poor health outcomes and the prevalence of violence may be higher amongst women seeking healthcare. Existing evidence from the Arab region is limited. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence and health outcomes of domestic violence (IPV or violence from a family member) in clinical populations in Arab countries.
   Methods: Using terms related to domestic violence, Arab countries, and date limit >= year 2000, we searched seven databases: Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science: core collection, IBSS, Westlaw, IMEMR. We included observational studies reporting estimates of prevalence or health outcomes of domestic violence amongst women aged >= 15 years, recruited while accessing healthcare in Arab countries. Studies that collected data on/after 1st January 2000 and were published in English, Arabic or French were included. Title/abstract screening, full text screening, quality assessment and data extraction were carried out. Extracted data were summarised and meta-analysis was performed where appropriate.
   Results: 6341 papers were screened and 41 papers (29 studies) met inclusion criteria. Total 19,101 participants from 10 countries were represented in the data. Meta-analysis produced pooled prevalence estimates of lifetime exposure to any type of IPV of 73.3% (95% CI 64.1-81.6), physical IPV 35.6% (95% CI 24.4-47.5), sexual IPV 22% (95% CI 13.3-32) and emotional/psychological IPV 49.8% (95% CI 37.3-62.3). Domestic violence (IPV or family violence) exposure was associated with increased odds of adverse health outcomes: depression OR 3.3 (95% CI 1.7-6.4), sleep problems OR 3.2 (95% CI 1.5-6.8), abortion OR 3.5 (95% CI 1.2-10.2), pain OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.6-4.1) and hypertension OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.2-2.0).
   Conclusions: Domestic violence is common amongst women seeking healthcare in Arab countries. Exposure to domestic violence is associated with several poor health outcomes. Further research into domestic violence in the Arab world is required.

TI  - Lifetime prevalence, associated factors, and circumstances of non-volitional sex in women and men in Britain: findings from the third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3)
T2  - LANCET
AB  - Background Sexual violence is increasingly recognised as a public health issue. Information about prevalence, associated factors, and consequences for health in the population of Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) is scarce. The third National Survey of Sexual Health Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3) is the first of the Natsal surveys to include questions about sexual violence and the first population-based survey in Britain to explore the issue outside the context of crime.
   Methods Between Sept 6, 2010, and Aug 31, 2012, we did a probability sample survey of women and men aged 16-74 years living in Britain. We asked participants about their experience of sex against their will since age 13 years and the circumstances surrounding the most recent occurrence. We explored associations between ever experiencing non-volitional sex and a range of sociodemographic, health, and behavioural factors. We used logistic regression to estimate age-adjusted odds ratios to analyse factors associated with the occurrence of completed non-volitional sex in women and men.
   Findings We interviewed 15 162 people. Completed non-volitional sex was reported by 9.8% (95% CI 9.0-10.5) of women and 1.4% (1.1-1.7) of men. Median age (interdecile range) at most recent occurrence was 18 years (14-32) for women and 16 years (13-30) for men. Completed non-volitional sex varied by family structure and, in women, by age, education, and area-level deprivation. It was associated with poor health, longstanding illness or disability, and treatment for mental health conditions, smoking, and use of non-prescription drugs in the past year in both sexes, and with binge drinking in women. Completed non-volitional sex was also associated with reporting of first heterosexual intercourse before 16 years of age, same-sex experience, more lifetime sexual partners, ever being diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection, and low sexual function in both sexes, and, in women, with abortion and pregnancy outcome before 18 years of age. In most cases, the person responsible was known to the individual, although the nature of the relationship differed by age at most recent occurrence. Participants who were younger at interview were more likely to have told someone about the event and to have reported it to the police than were older participants.
   Interpretation These data provide the first population prevalence estimates of non-volitional sex in Britain. We showed it to be mainly an experience of young age and strongly associated with a range of adverse health outcomes in both women and men.

TI  - Prenatal and Obstetric Parameters of Late Terminations: A Retrospective Analysis
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
AB  - Background In Germany, the highly sensitive issue of late terminations of pregnancy and feticide is regulated in Sec. 218a para. 2 of the German Penal Code (medical indication). This study aimed to investigate the prenatal obstetric approach after feticide and the rate of maternal complications.
   Material and Methods All feticides of singleton pregnancies carried out at Leipzig University Hospital (n = 164) in the period between 01/2016 and 12/2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Selective feticides of multiple pregnancies were excluded from the study. Target indicators for the prenatal obstetric approach were sonographic accuracy of estimation, method used to induce feticide, time between feticide and delivery, and whether curettage was required. The rate of maternal complications was defined as blood loss of >= 500ml.
   Results The number of feticides as a percentage of the total number of births during the investigation period was 1.6%. None of the terminations were performed primarily because of a serious risk to the mother's physical health; all of the indications to terminate the pregnancy were based on the psychosocial burden and the risk to the mother's mental health as outlined in Sec. 218a StGB (German Penal Code). The most common fetal diagnoses in the context of a maternal psychosocial emergency were central nervous system abnormalities (29.3%), numerical chromosomal aberrations (29.3%) and structural chromosomal aberrations/syndromes (21.3%). Sonographic measurements were used to estimate fetal weight and the weight of around half of the fetuses was underestimated (- 121.8 +/- 155.8 g). The margin of estimation error increased with increasing gestational age (p < 0.001). Misoprostol was the most common drug administered to induce labor. No significant association was found between the method chosen for induction, parity, fetal birth position, fetal anomaly, fetal gender, birth mode or the number of previous cesarean sections and Delta delivery. However, a significantly higher loss of blood was observed with longer Delta delivery (p = 0.02). The likelihood of requiring curettage increased with increasing loss of blood. The number of maternal complications as a percentage of the total patient population was 10.4%. Only 11% of patients agreed to a postmortem examination.
   Conclusion Late terminations of pregnancy carried out in accordance with Sec. 218a para. 2 StGB are a reality andmust be understood and accepted as a possible consequence of modern prenatal medicine. The complication rate after feticide and the subsequent obstetric procedure was 10% for the above-defined maternal complication. Late terminations and their obstetric management should be carried out in specialized perinatal centers which offer interprofessional expertise.

TI  - Effects of Comprehensive Nursing Based on Orem's Self-Care Theory on Symptom Improvement and Pregnancy Outcome in Patients with Antiphospholipid Syndrome: A Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Objective. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to explore the effects of comprehensive nursing based on Orem's self-care theory on symptom improvement and pregnancy outcomes in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Methods. Sixty patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome treated in our hospital from February 2019 to April 2021 were enrolled. The control group received comprehensive nursing, while the study group received comprehensive nursing based on Orem's self-care theory. Nursing satisfaction, self-nursing ability, anxiety score, social support status, pregnancy outcome, and the score of life quality were compared between the two groups. Results. First of all, we compared the nursing satisfaction, the study group was very satisfied in 23 cases, satisfactory in 5 cases, general in 2 cases, the satisfaction rate was 100.00%. While in the control group, 11 cases were very satisfied, 10 cases were satisfied, 4 cases were general, and 5 cases were dissatisfied, the satisfaction rate was 83.33%. The nursing satisfaction in the study group was higher compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Secondly, the self-concept, sense of self-care responsibility, self-nursing skills, health knowledge, and total score of the study group were higher compared to the control group (P < 0.05). After intervention, the anxiety scores of the two groups decreased. Compared between the two groups, the anxiety scores of the study group before intervention and 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and 4 weeks after intervention were lower compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The comparison of social support showed that the scores of objective support, subjective support, utilization of support, and total score of social support in the study group were higher compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The number of abortions in the control group was lower compared to the control group, and the number of full-term deliveries was higher compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Finally, we compared the scores of life quality. After nursing, the scores of life quality of the two groups increased. Of note, the scores of physiological function, psychological function, social function, and health self-cognition in the study group were lower compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion. Comprehensive nursing for patients with APS based on Orem's self-care theory can effectively improve clinical symptoms and pregnancy outcome and play a positive role in facilitating patients' nursing satisfaction and self-nursing ability, which can also effectively strengthen mental health and social support, this nursing model is worth popularizing in clinic.

TI  - Prevalence of postpartum depression at the clinic for obstetrics and gynecology in Kosovo teaching hospital: Demographic, obstetric and psychosocial risk factors
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Postpartum depression affects 10 up to 15 % of women of childbearing age in industrialized countries and presents significant public health problem which leads to short and long-term consequences for mother, child and her family. However, social determinants, including poverty, gender stereotypes, domestic violence, gender discrimination and cultural differences make this medical issue more problematic in less developed countries. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of postpartum depression at the Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynecology in Pristina, Kosovo (a tertiary referral center).
   Material and methods: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted from June 2019 to October 2019 at the Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynecology in Pristina, Kosovo. A total of 247 delivery women were screened for postpartum depression at 6 weeks following delivery using the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Socio-demographic, obstetric and psychologic factors were tested as predictors of PPD using bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis (Logit model). Odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for each risk factor. The p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
   Results: The prevalence of PPD at the Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynecology in Kosovo teaching hospital was 21 % at 6 weeks following childbirth.
   The bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis identified four predictor variables for postpartum depression: pregnancy complications (OR 1.057; 95 % CI; 1.002-1.114 and P= 0.040); fear of childbirth (OR 1.121; 95 % CI; 1.057-1.190 and P = 0.00016); prenatal depression or anxiety (OR 1.088; 95 CI; 1.032-1.147 and P = 0.0018); poor marital relation (OR 1.085, 95 % CI; 1.002-1.174 and P = 0.044). No statistically significant association was found between the postpartum depression (PPD) and maternal age, education, employment, family type, smoking, previous abortion, parity, household income, social support, child gender, birthweight, and breast feeding.
   Conclusions: The high prevalence of postpartum depression in our setting and its known adverse effects on woman, infant and her family implies an urgent need for evidence-based interventions. Such interventions are needed to promote knowledge of perinatal mental illness and improve maternal mental health in particular in less developed countries.
   Future efforts should address early identification of high-risk women, assessment of risk factor during the antenatal period, early postpartum depression screening and timely therapeutic approaches, to improve social and psychological functioning of the woman.

TI  - Delivery arrangements for health systems in low-income countries: an overview of systematic reviews
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Delivery arrangements include changes in who receives care and when, who provides care, the working conditions of those who provide care, coordination of care amongst different providers, where care is provided, the use of information and communication technology to deliver care, and quality and safety systems. How services are delivered can have impacts on the effectiveness, efficiency and equity of health systems. This broad overview of the findings of systematic reviews can help policymakers and other stakeholders identify strategies for addressing problems and improve the delivery of services.
   Objectives
   To provide an overview of the available evidence from up-to-date systematic reviews about the effects of delivery arrangements for health systems in low-income countries. Secondary objectives include identifying needs and priorities for future evaluations and systematic reviews on delivery arrangements and informing refinements of the framework for delivery arrangements outlined in the review.
   Methods
   We searched Health Systems Evidence in November 2010 and PDQ-Evidence up to 17 December 2016 for systematic reviews. We did not apply any date, language or publication status limitations in the searches. We included well-conducted systematic reviews of studies that assessed the effects of delivery arrangements on patient outcomes (health and health behaviours), the quality or utilisation of healthcare services, resource use, healthcare provider outcomes (such as sick leave), or social outcomes (such as poverty or employment) and that were published after April 2005. We excluded reviews with limitations important enough to compromise the reliability of the findings. Two overview authors independently screened reviews, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We prepared SUPPORT Summaries for eligible reviews, including key messages, 'Summary of findings' tables (using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence), and assessments of the relevance of findings to low-income countries.
   Main results
   We identified 7272 systematic reviews and included 51 of them in this overview. We judged 6 of the 51 reviews to have important methodological limitations and the other 45 to have only minor limitations. We grouped delivery arrangements into eight categories. Some reviews provided more than one comparison and were in more than one category. Across these categories, the following intervention were effective; that is, they have desirable effects on at least one outcome with moderate-or high-certainty evidence and no moderate- or high-certainty evidence of undesirable effects.
   Who receives care and when: queuing strategies and antenatal care to groups of mothers.
   Who provides care: lay health workers for caring for people with hypertension, lay health workers to deliver care for mothers and children or infectious diseases, lay health workers to deliver community-based neonatal care packages, midlevel health professionals for abortion care, social support to pregnant women at risk, midwife-led care for childbearing women, non-specialist providers in mental health and neurology, and physician-nurse substitution.
   Coordination of care: hospital clinical pathways, case management for people living with HIV and AIDS, interactive communication between primary care doctors and specialists, hospital discharge planning, adding a service to an existing service and integrating delivery models, referral from primary to secondary care, physician-led versus nurse-led triage in emergency departments, and team midwifery.
   Where care is provided: high-volume institutions, home-based care (with or without multidisciplinary team) for people living with HIV and AIDS, home-based management of malaria, home care for children with acute physical conditions, community-based interventions for childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia, out-of-facility HIV and reproductive health services for youth, and decentralised HIV care.
   Information and communication technology: mobile phone messaging for patients with long-term illnesses, mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments, mobile phone messaging to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy, women carrying their own case notes in pregnancy, interventions to improve childhood vaccination.
   Quality and safety systems: decision support with clinical information systems for people living with HIV/AIDS.
   Complex interventions (cutting across delivery categories and other health system arrangements): emergency obstetric referral interventions.
   Authors' conclusions
   A wide range of strategies have been evaluated for improving delivery arrangements in low-income countries, using sound systematic review methods in both Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews. These reviews have assessed a range of outcomes. Most of the available evidence focuses on who provides care, where care is provided and coordination of care. For all the main categories of delivery arrangements, we identified gaps in primary research related to uncertainty about the applicability of the evidence to low-income countries, low-or very low-certainty evidence or a lack of studies.

TI  - Psychosocial research on street living children developed by the INP during the last 25 years
T2  - SALUD MENTAL
AB  - In the mid 1970's, a series of psychosocial studies about children and adolescents living on the street was started at the Mexican Center of Addictions (Centro Mexicano de Estudios en Farmacodependencia). These studies have been followed by different research teams for the past 25 years at the National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente.
   Ever since its beginnings, this research has rendered relevant knowledge about the diversity of situations that endanger the children's mental health on the streets, as,well as of their strategies to face adversities. The information obtained has been very useful to develop intervention programs and to consult, train, and express recommendations to both governmental and non-governmental organizations in charge of caring for childhood 'on street situation'. The development of this series of studies can be divided into two broad periods.
   In the first stage, both qualitative and quantitative research were focused on understanding the problems of child sustenance on the streets. The qualitative studies intended to describe the use of inhalants among children living on the streets. Also, the study observed the children's social organization, values, and the personal characteristics needed to prevail. To that effect, a group of 23 boys and one girl that slept on the streets was observed. The group was in average 9 years old. It was found that the whole groups sniffed toluene at least 4 days a week. Almost always, their first worry as they woke up was to buy a toluene sample. The subjects in the study also noticed in themselves a higher degree of intoxication when they had to handle sad situations. Finally, It was reported that children organized among themselves to face street difficulties. Furthermore, some children became leaders with the ability to organize the actions needed for the solutions to 9 personal and collective problems.
   On the other hand, the qualitative research evaluated the use of inhalants within small samples of street children as well as the factors that encourage it. The study tried to determine the neurological and psychological consequences of inhaling solvents deliberately. In one of these studies, it was found that of 329 subjects (94% male), with an average age of 13.7 years, 27% admitted to sniff daily. The average period of inhalant use was found to be 4.5 years. The general traits associated with the use of inhalants were: male sex, low schooling and school desertion, early start of work, alcohol and/or drug consumption of mother, siblings, and friends, low or null contact with family, and migration from rural areas.
   In the second research stage, the development of studies on inhalant abuse of 'street children' was continued. The quantitative studies examined larger samples of street children in 100 cities across the country and in the Federal District. In this respect, in the Federal District report it is noted that alcohol and tobacco are the most commonly abused substances by working minors: 26% of men and 14% of women reported smoking. The most frequently used illegal drugs were inhalants, followed by marijuana and cocaine and to a lesser extent psychotropic pills. The most important factor linked to drug use,vas the minor's occupation. It was observed that minors working as packers had low indexes of consumption of illegal drugs (2.4% of those aged between 12 and 17 years has used drugs). Those minors working in public areas had higher consumption rates (8.1%), and a considerably higher rate was found among minors living on the streets (76%).
   In this period, the qualitative studies were dramatically increased. These studies started to pay much more attention to the street childrens views and opinions. This research also tried to focus on other problems of life in the streets like police violence and child prostitution. Moreover, we started identifying the protective factors that help children face the difficulties of sustenance on the streets.
   In this second stage, a new study was developed in order to understand the situation of the female adolescent inhalers on the street. It is,worth noticing that this group of subjects had not had a central role in our previous research. The research tried to get to know, from their own point of view, situations such as: the way they experience solvent sniffing; their sexual practices, pregnancy and delivery; self-attention and institutional support. The results obtained show that the so called 'street girls' experience the use of inhalants as a habit. They manifested that they frequently have unprotected sexual practices, unplanned pregnancies, violence prior to abortions, risky deliveries, etc. All this phenomena become extremely complex, hence forcing these young,women to experience them as something contradictory, confusing, mysterious, ambivalent, fatal, and paradoxical. The research show,vs that the female adolescents 'of the street' do not relate these experiences to the problems pertaining to the Mexican social structure, such as the low emphasis on family planning among adolescents, the lack of orientation and sensitivity towards young pregnant women on matters such as prenatal medical attention, the absence of programs geared toward adolescence abusing substances, etc.
   We conclude that it would be highly beneficial that any new research be focused on the children's perspective. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the children's experiences and strategies to face adversity. This would enable us to identify matters that are important for the children themselves. For instance, this approach would not only be helpful to identify particular aspects that endanger the children's mental health, but also those characteristics that enable the child to face risk situations. Furthermore, the concepts of risk and resilience could provide a thorough understanding of the children 'on street situation'. Hence, it is quite necessary to look beyond the risk variables and turn to the search of comparative and longitudinal information about the,street career' followed by these children.

TI  - Crime, community social capital and entrepreneurship: Evidence from Australian communities
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING
AB  - Crime is an anti-social blight on communities that increases the cost of doing business, including for entrepreneurs. Drawing on Australian longitudinal data, this study examines the links between crime rates and the propensity for entrepreneurship within communities. We do so by matching propensity for entrepreneurship with types of crime found at the community level where crime occurs. We find that higher total crime rates, crimes against the person and property crime, significantly lower the propensity for entrepreneurship in communities. We also show that the core facets of community social capital - trust, membership in voluntary organizations and support and cooperation - mediate this relationship. Executive summary: We comprehensively examine whether higher community crime rates - crime on people and crime on property - cause lower rates of entrepreneurship. Entre-preneurship research extensively examines how gaining social capital, defined as the social re-sources one gains within one's community, promotes entrepreneurship. This study considers whether a pervasive community dynamic in crime impedes entrepreneurship. Specifically, we show that the two main kinds of crime - people and property - inhibit entrepreneurship. We show the facets of community social capital that mediate the relationship between crime and entrepreneurship. We inform the role of community-based social capital in pro-moting entrepreneurship (Kwon et al., 2013) by considering how higher crime lowers social capital and in turn entrepreneurship. We show that core facets of relational social capital - trust, voluntary membership in community bodies, support, and cooperation - mediate the relationship between crime and entrepreneurship. Likewise, communities with more robust reserves of social capital are better able to withstand crime and promote entrepreneurship. Examining the link between crime and entrepreneurship allows us to contribute to the literature on entrepreneurship and social capital. We discuss the various ways in which crime diminishes social capital to shape entrepreneurship. In our framework that is predicated on theory on community social capital, crime creates distrust because it causes citizens to be wearier and more suspicious of each other, impeding sharing of ideas and knowledge for ventures. Crime impedes the efficacy and membership of community-based organizations that allow entrepre-neurs to network. Crime reduces the support available for founders to start and sustain businesses in focal communities, as individuals seek opportunities and resources outside their communities. Crime diminishes the extent to which people take pride in and identify with their communities, as evidenced by voluntary membership in community organizations. Crime reduces collaboration because it leads to self-protective behaviors, including flight from high-crime communities, that hinder norms of reciprocity. Crime reduces cooperation as criminals are more likely to resort to coercion, as enforced by monitoring and violence, to solve business problems. Findings rely on a comprehensive database of crime rates across Australian postcodes. Crime is typically a localized phenomenon - it affects business outcomes in local communities. We obtain community-level crime rates from each Australian state and territory police force or relevant government agencies and match these data with entrepreneurship rates by postcode.
   Our primary identification strategy follows Dustmann and Fasani (2016), who estimate the effect of local area crime on mental health in the United Kingdom (UK). This identification strategy removes the effects of residential sorting and correlates crime with time-varying unobserved entrepreneurship determinants if there is no endogenous migration from local crime. The main findings are robust to instrumenting for local area crime to which movers are exposed and for historical abortion rates in the state or territory where the individual lives, as well as a number of other approaches to obtaining causal inference. The article holds considerable practical relevance for policymakers seeking to promote community entrepreneurship. Our study is highly relevant to community leaders and policy -makers working to boost local entrepreneurship. Findings strongly suggest that efforts to reduce crime are a primary mechanism to protect social capital within communities and, therefore, entrepreneurship. Policy initiatives dedicated to creating and expanding social ventures would a) boost entrepreneurship and social capital and b) mitigate the detrimental effects of crime on entrepreneurship (Wry and York, 2017).

TI  - Risky eating behaviors and body image according with body mass index distribution in Mexican adult woman sample.
T2  - SALUD MENTAL
AB  - Studies conducted in adolescent and young women have showed that body image perception and dissatisfaction are highly related with risk eating behaviors, particularly with compensatory behaviors. It has also been found that these women tend to overestimate their body size, showing more dissatisfaction.
   Many studies on eating disorders have been developed in adolescents, but, what happens with adult women?
   Adult women show periods of pregnancy, nursing, menstrual disorders and, a decrease in physical activity and, at the psychological level there is a lack of emotional stability and depression.
   These episodes in general, have influence in feeding and body image, that could lead to risky eating behaviors (restricted dieting, fasting; skipping meals among others) affecting directly the state of health, because latter they can develop into eating disorders.
   Undoubtedly, inadequate feeding can cause malnutrition and nutrimental deficiencies, provoking physiological alterations such as osteoporosis, anemia or hypokaliemia, and also, somatic complications during pregnancy, including abortions and low weight in the new born.
   Objective. To determine the relationship between body mass index (BMI), risky eating behaviours, body perception and body dissatisfaction in Mexican adult women from 25 to 45 years of age in Mexico City.
   Methods. A non probabilistic sample of 659 women from 25 to 45 years of age (X=38.27; SD=4.4) was used.
   To collect the sample, an area of the Questionnaire for Health and Feeding called scale of risk factors associated to eating disorders (EFRATA) and body image was used. This is a self-report questionnaire, validated for this population. Its main purpose is to measure risk eating behaviors and body image. Questions refer to risky eating behaviors (binge eating, compensatory behaviors, restricted dieting, preoccupation about weight and figure), with 4 answering options: 1) Never, 2) Sometimes, 3) Frequently, and 4) Always.
   Body Image was measured through two dimensions: (a) Body perception was measured through five specific items and (b) Body dissatisfaction was measured with a nine body figure scale, from thin to obese. The BMI was obtained from weight and height self-report (BMI=kg/m(2)). Self report measures of weight and height have been found reliable; as there is a high correlation with data taken directly, the difference between them is 1.14 kg/m(2), which does not interfere significantly. The cut points recommended by the Expert Committee (OMS), are: low weight from 15 to 18.5; normal weight from 18.51 to 24.99; overweight from 25 to 29.99; obesity from 30 to 39.99 and morbid obesity higher than 40.
   Results. Body Mass Index distribution of the sample was: 1.1% low weight, 53.6% normal weight, 32.3% overweight, 12.4% obesity, and 0.6% of women were morbidly obese. Body perception distribution was: 0.9% very thin, 15.3% thin, 44.4% normal, 32.6% overweight and 6.8% obese.
   Results related to body dissatisfaction, showed that more than 3/4 of the sample was dissatisfied; 70.1% of the women were dissatisfied with their body image and wanted to be thinner and, 8.7% wanted to gain weight.
   It was found that a large percentage of women (79%) are dissatisfied with their body image. From this percentage 70.1 wanted to be thinner and, 8.7% wanted to gain weight.
   As to the relationship between BMI distribution and body dissatisfaction it was found that 14% of underweight and 54.2% normal weight women want to be even thinner.
   The findings of the study showed that women with higher BMI, displayed more risky eating behaviors. Women with overweight and obesity displayed the higher percentages in binge eating.
   A Pearson correlation was carried out to look for significant differences between BMI, risky eating behaviors and the two dimensions of body image (perception and dissatisfaction). Results indicated that BMI was significantly correlated with binge eating, body dissatisfaction and body image perception. Discussion. This study supported important information about the relation between BMI and risky eating behaviors in Mexican adult women. The most important result was to confirm the presence of disordered eating typical of eating disorders among adult women. Even though the data obtained do not demonstrate the diagnosis of an ED, it shows the presence of some of the characteristic symptoms, which means that these are commonles found among the general population. Although isolated symptoms are not a necessary indicator of the development of the disease, in a way they point out the individuals who are at risk of threatening their physical and mental health. On the other hand, one of the risks that adds to this particular population is the fact that all of them are mothers, as some research findings have confirmed the relationship between the mother's eating behaviors and the appearance of eating disorders in their children.
   The results obtained in this research show that the BMI of the sample tends to be in the overweight (32.3%) and obese ranges (13%). These results agree with those of the National Nutrition Survey of 1999, were 52.5% of the women were classified as overweight or obese (30.8% as overweight and 21.7% as obese). These scores are important not just because they favor chronic-degenerative diseases, but also because of the great association between overweight and obesity with risky eating behaviors, something that could be confirmed in this study, as individuals with higher BMI, displayed more risky eating behaviors. The results of this study have consistently supported the positive relationship between BMI, binge eating, body dissatisfaction and body image perception, although group differences attributed to age were not statistically significant.
   Finally, another important contribution of this study, is the use of a reliable and valid multi dimentional questionnaire developed in Mexico, specifically designed for the study of two very complex issues such as risky eating behaviors and body image.
   The main limitations of the study were that the findings were primarily based on self-report data and the use of a nonprobabilistic sample of Mexican adult women.
