AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The early medical literature on mental health outcomes following abortion is fraught with methodological flaws that can improperly  influence clinical practice. Our goal is to review the current medical literature  on depression and other mental health outcomes for women obtaining abortions.  RECENT FINDINGS: The Turnaway Study prospectively enrolled 956 women seeking  abortion in the USA and followed their mental health outcomes for 5Â years. The  control group was comprised of women denied abortions based on gestational age  limits, thereby circumventing the major methodological flaw that had plagued  earlier studies on the topic. Rates of depression are not significantly different  between women obtaining abortion and those denied abortion. Rates of anxiety are  initially higher in women denied abortion care. Counseling on decision-making for  women with unintended pregnancies should reflect these findings.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Induced abortion is widely believed - by the public, healthcare professionals, and policy-makers - to lead to adverse mental health  sequelae. This belief is false, as it applies both to adult women and  adolescents. However, it has been used to rationalize, and been quoted in,  restrictive and intrusive legislation in several states and in proposed federal  legislation. It is essential for gynecologists to have accurate information, as  clinicians, for their patients, and, as key experts, for policy makers. RECENT  FINDINGS: New articles concluding that there are adverse psychological outcomes  from induced abortion continue to be published. The methodological flaws in these  articles are so serious as to invalidate those conclusions. Several recent  scholarly analyses detail these flaws. Methodologically sound studies and reviews  continue to demonstrate that psychosocial problems play a role in unwanted  conception and the decision to abort unwanted pregnancies but are not the result  of abortion. SUMMARY: Clinicians may have to reassure patients making decisions  about their pregnancies that abortion does not cause psychiatric illness. They  can do so on the basis of recent analyses substantiating that finding.

AB  - The risk that abortion may be correlated with subsequent mental disorders needs a careful assessment, in order to offer women full information when facing a  difficult pregnancy. All research papers published between 1995 and 2011, were  examined, to retrieve those assessing any correlation between abortion and  subsequent mental problems. A total of 36 studies were retrieved, and six of them  were excluded for methodological bias. Depression, anxiety disorders (e.g.  post-traumatic stress disorder) and substance abuse disorders were the most  studied outcome. Abortion versus childbirth: 13 studies showed a clear risk for  at least one of the reported mental problems in the abortion group versus  childbirth, five papers showed no difference, in particular if women do not  consider their experience of fetal loss to be difficult, or if after a fetal  reduction the desired fetus survives. Only one paper reported a worse mental  outcome for childbearing. Abortion versus unplanned pregnancies ending with  childbirth: four studies found a higher risk in the abortion groups and three, no  difference. Abortion versus miscarriage: three studies showed a greater risk of  mental disorders due to abortion, four found no difference and two found that  short-term anxiety and depression were higher in the miscarriage group, while  long-term anxiety and depression were present only in the abortion group. In  conclusion, fetal loss seems to expose women to a higher risk for mental  disorders than childbirth; some studies show that abortion can be considered a  more relevant risk factor than miscarriage; more research is needed in this  field.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The idea that abortion leads to adverse psychological outcomes has been the basis for legislation mandating counseling before obtaining an abortion  and other policies to restrict access to abortion. OBJECTIVE: To assess women's  psychological well-being 5 years after receiving or being denied an abortion.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study presents data from the Turnaway  Study, a prospective longitudinal study with a quasi-experimental design. Women  were recruited from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2010, from 30 abortion  facilities in 21 states throughout the United States, interviewed via telephone 1  week after seeking an abortion, and then interviewed semiannually for 5 years,  totaling 11 interview waves. Interviews were completed January 31, 2016. We  examined the psychological trajectories of women who received abortions just  under the facility's gestational limit (near-limit group) and compared them with  women who sought but were denied an abortion because they were just beyond the  facility gestational limit (turnaway group, which includes the turnaway-birth and  turnaway-no-birth groups). We used mixed effects linear and logistic regression  analyses to assess whether psychological trajectories differed by study group.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We included 6 measures of mental health and  well-being: 2 measures of depression and 2 measures of anxiety assessed using the  Brief Symptom Inventory, as well as self-esteem, and life satisfaction. RESULTS:  Of the 956 women (mean [SD] age, 24.9 [5.8] years) in the study, at 1 week after  seeking an abortion, compared with the near-limit group, women denied an abortion  reported more anxiety symptoms (turnaway-births, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.01 to 1.13;  turnaway-no-births, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.39 to 3.18), lower self-esteem  (turnaway-births, -0.33; 95% CI, -0.56 to -0.09; turnaway-no-births, -0.40; 95%  CI, -0.78 to -0.02), lower life satisfaction (turnaway-births, -0.16; 95% CI,  -0.38 to 0.06; turnaway-no-births, -0.41; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.06), and similar  levels of depression (turnaway-births, 0.13; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.72;  turnaway-no-births, 0.44; 95% CI, -0.50 to 1.39). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In  this study, compared with having an abortion, being denied an abortion may be  associated with greater risk of initially experiencing adverse psychological  outcomes. Psychological well-being improved over time so that both groups of  women eventually converged. These findings do not support policies that restrict  women's access to abortion on the basis that abortion harms women's mental  health.

AB  - Psychological research is increasingly involved in debates regarding abortion. While recognizing the diversity of ethical and moral issues intertwined with  abortion, the American Psychological Association (APA) has focused its  involvement on psychological factors, most recently by appointing an expert panel  to review the literature on psychological effects. This article notes the history  of APA involvement and reports on the panel's conclusions. It presents evidence  that abortion is not likely to be followed by severe psychological responses and  that psychological aspects can best be understood within a framework of normal  stress and coping rather than a model of psychopathology. Correlates of more  negative responses following abortion are also discussed.

AB  - The authors evaluated empirical research addressing the relationship between induced abortion and women's mental health. Two issues were addressed: (a) the  relative risks associated with abortion compared with the risks associated with  its alternatives and (b) sources of variability in women's responses following  abortion. This article reflects and updates the report of the American  Psychological Association Task Force on Mental Health and Abortion (2008). Major  methodological problems pervaded most of the research reviewed. The most rigorous  studies indicated that within the United States, the relative risk of mental  health problems among adult women who have a single, legal, first-trimester  abortion of an unwanted pregnancy is no greater than the risk among women who  deliver an unwanted pregnancy. Evidence did not support the claim that observed  associations between abortion and mental health problems are caused by abortion  per se as opposed to other preexisting and co-occurring risk factors. Most adult  women who terminate a pregnancy do not experience mental health problems. Some  women do, however. It is important that women's varied experiences of abortion be  recognized, validated, and understood.

AB  - The decision to seek an abortion is never easy. Women have different reasons for choosing an abortion and their social, economic and religious background may  influence how they cope. Furthermore, once pregnant, the alternatives of  childbirth and adoption or keeping the baby may not be psychologically neutral.  Research studies in this area have been hampered by methodological problems, but  most of the better-quality studies have shown no increased risk of mental health  problems in women having an abortion. A consistent finding has been that of  pre-existing mental illness and subsequent mental health problems after either  abortion or childbirth. Furthermore, studies have shown that only a minority of  women experience any lasting sadness or regret. Risk factors for this include  ambivalence about the decision, level of social support and whether or not the  pregnancy was originally intended. More robust, definitive research studies are  required on mental health after abortion and alternative outcomes such as  childbirth.

AB  - Research into the potential mental health consequences of abortion yields inconsistent results and is characterized by methodological limitations.<br />  AIM: To offer a more conclusive insight into women's mental health after an  abortion by stringently taking both pre-abortion mental health and confounding  covariates into account.<br /> METHOD: A prospective longitudinal cohort study,  the Dutch Abortion and Mental Health Study (DAMHS), through which women with and  without abortion experiences could be compared. The study was designed in a  similar way to the large scale Dutch population study into mental health of the  Trimbos Institute, the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2  (NEMESIS-2).<br /> RESULTS: Women who had an abortion were significantly more  likely to have had previous DSM-IV mental disorders. Psychiatric history appeared  to be associated with how women experienced and handled the unwanted pregnancy  and abortion. A prior history of mental disorders, averse recent life events or  an unstable partner relationship increased the risk of developing post abortion  mental disorders, while experiencing an abortion did not.<br /> CONCLUSION: Women  who have had an abortion more often have a history of mental disorders, yet there  is no evidence that an abortion in itself would increase the risk of developing a  mental disorder.

AU  - Coleman, Priscilla K.
T2  - The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the methodological limitations of recently published qualitative reviews of abortion and mental health, a quantitative synthesis was  deemed necessary to represent more accurately the published literature and to  provide clarity to clinicians. AIMS: To measure the association between abortion  and indicators of adverse mental health, with subgroup effects calculated based  on comparison groups (no abortion, unintended pregnancy delivered, pregnancy  delivered) and particular outcomes. A secondary objective was to calculate  population-attributable risk (PAR) statistics for each outcome. METHOD: After the  application of methodologically based selection criteria and extraction rules to  minimise bias, the sample comprised 22 studies, 36 measures of effect and 877 181  participants (163 831 experienced an abortion). Random effects pooled odds ratios  were computed using adjusted odds ratios from the original studies and PAR  statistics were derived from the pooled odds ratios. RESULTS: Women who had  undergone an abortion experienced an 81% increased risk of mental health  problems, and nearly 10% of the incidence of mental health problems was shown to  be attributable to abortion. The strongest subgroup estimates of increased risk  occurred when abortion was compared with term pregnancy and when the outcomes  pertained to substance use and suicidal behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: This review  offers the largest quantitative estimate of mental health risks associated with  abortion available in the world literature. Calling into question the conclusions  from traditional reviews, the results revealed a moderate to highly increased  risk of mental health problems after abortion. Consistent with the tenets of  evidence-based medicine, this information should inform the delivery of abortion  services.

AB  - Claims that women who have elective abortions will experience psychological distress have fueled much of the recent debate on abortion. It has been argued  that the emotional sequelae of abortion may not occur until months or years after  the event. Despite unclear evidence on such a phenomenon, adverse mental health  outcomes of abortion have been used as a rationale for policy-making. We  systematically searched for articles focused on the potential association between  abortion and long-term mental health outcomes published between January 1, 1989  and August 1, 2008 and reviewed 21 studies that met the inclusion criteria. We  rated the study quality based on methodological factors necessary to  appropriately explore the research question. Studies were rated as Excellent (no  studies), Very Good (4 studies), Fair (8 studies), Poor (8 studies), or Very Poor  (1 study). A clear trend emerges from this systematic review: the highest quality  studies had findings that were mostly neutral, suggesting few, if any,  differences between women who had abortions and their respective comparison  groups in terms of mental health sequelae. Conversely, studies with the most  flawed methodology found negative mental health sequelae of abortion.

TI  - Later abortions and mental health: psychological experiences of women having later abortions--a critical review of research.
AU  - Steinberg, Julia R.
T2  - Women's health issues : official publication of the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some abortion policies in the U.S. are based on the notion that abortion harms women's mental health. The American Psychological Association  (APA) Task Force on Abortion and Mental Health concluded that first-trimester  abortions do not harm women's mental health. However, the APA task force does not  make conclusions regarding later abortions (second trimester or beyond) and  mental health. This paper critically evaluates studies on later abortion and  mental health in order to inform both policy and practice. METHOD: Using  guidelines outlined by Steinberg and Russo (2009), post 1989 quantitative studies  on later abortion and mental health were evaluated on the following qualities: 1)  composition of comparison groups, 2) how prior mental health was assessed, and 3)  whether common risk factors were controlled for in analyses if a significant  relationship between abortion and mental health was found. Studies were evaluated  with respect to the claim that later abortions harm women's mental health.  RESULTS: Eleven quantitative studies that compared the mental health of women  having later abortions (for reasons of fetal anomaly) with other groups were  evaluated. Findings differed depending on the comparison group. No studies  considered the role of prepregnancy mental health, and one study considered  whether factors common among women having later abortions and mental health  problems drove the association between later abortion and mental health.  CONCLUSION: Policies based on the notion that later abortions (because of fetal  anomaly) harm women's mental health are unwarranted. Because research suggests  that most women who have later abortions do so for reasons other than fetal  anomaly, future investigations should examine women's psychological experiences  around later abortions.

AU  - Fergusson, David M.

AU  - Boden, Joseph M.
T2  - The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There have been debates about the linkages between abortion and mental health. Few reviews have considered the extent to which abortion has therapeutic  benefits that mitigate the mental health risks of abortion. The aim of this  review was to conduct a re-appraisal of the evidence to examine the research  hypothesis that abortion reduces rates of mental health problems in women having  unwanted or unintended pregnancy. METHODS: Analysis of recent reviews (Coleman,  2011; National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2011) identified eight  publications reporting 14 adjusted odds ratios (AORs) spanning five outcome  domains: anxiety; depression; alcohol misuse; illicit drug use/misuse; and  suicidal behaviour. For each outcome, pooled AORs were estimated using a  random-effects model. RESULTS: There was consistent evidence to show that  abortion was not associated with a reduction in rates of mental health problems  (p>0.75). Abortion was associated with small to moderate increases in risks of  anxiety (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 0.97-1.70; p<0.08), alcohol misuse (AOR 2.34, 95% CI  1.05-5.21; p<0.05), illicit drug use/misuse (AOR 3.91, 95% CI 1.13-13.55;  p<0.05), and suicidal behaviour (AOR 1.69, 95% CI 1.12-2.54; p<0.01).  CONCLUSIONS: There is no available evidence to suggest that abortion has  therapeutic effects in reducing the mental health risks of unwanted or unintended  pregnancy. There is suggestive evidence that abortion may be associated with  small to moderate increases in risks of some mental health problems.

AB  - This survey of studies which relate to the emotional sequelae of induced abortion, draws attention to the need for more long-term, in-depth prospective  studies. The literature to this point finds no psychiatric indications for  abortion, and no satisfactory evidence that abortion improves the psychological  state of those not mentally ill; abortion is contra-indicated when psychiatric  disease is present, as mental ill-health has been shown to be worsened by  abortion. Recent studies are turning up an alarming rate of post-abortion  complications such as P.I.D., and subsequent infertility. The emotional impact of  these complications needs to be studied. Other considerations looked at are the  long-term demographic implications of abortion on demand and the effect on the  medical professions.

TI  - The abortion and mental health controversy: A comprehensive literature review of common ground agreements, disagreements, actionable recommendations, and research  opportunities.
AU  - Reardon, David C.
T2  - SAGE open medicine
AB  - The abortion and mental health controversy is driven by two different perspectives regarding how best to interpret accepted facts. When interpreting  the data, abortion and mental health proponents are inclined to emphasize risks  associated with abortion, whereas abortion and mental health minimalists  emphasize pre-existing risk factors as the primary explanation for the  correlations with more negative outcomes. Still, both sides agree that (a)  abortion is consistently associated with elevated rates of mental illness  compared to women without a history of abortion; (b) the abortion experience  directly contributes to mental health problems for at least some women; (c) there  are risk factors, such as pre-existing mental illness, that identify women at  greatest risk of mental health problems after an abortion; and (d) it is  impossible to conduct research in this field in a manner that can definitively  identify the extent to which any mental illnesses following abortion can be  reliably attributed to abortion in and of itself. The areas of disagreement,  which are more nuanced, are addressed at length. Obstacles in the way of research  and further consensus include (a) multiple pathways for abortion and mental  health risks, (b) concurrent positive and negative reactions, (c) indeterminate  time frames and degrees of reactions, (d) poorly defined terms, (e) multiple  factors of causation, and (f) inherent preconceptions based on ideology and  disproportionate exposure to different types of women. Recommendations for  collaboration include (a) mixed research teams, (b) co-design of national  longitudinal prospective studies accessible to any researcher, (c) better  adherence to data sharing and re-analysis standards, and (d) attention to a  broader list of research questions.

TI  - The effects of induced abortion on emotional experiences and relationships: a critical review of the literature.
AU  - Bradshaw, ZoÃ«
AU  - Slade, Pauline
T2  - Clinical psychology review
AB  - This paper reviews post-1990 literature concerning psychological experiences and sexual relationships prior to and following induced abortion. It assesses whether  conclusions drawn from earlier reviews are still supported and evaluates the  extent to which previous methodological problems have been addressed. Following  discovery of pregnancy and prior to abortion, 40-45% of women experience  significant levels of anxiety and around 20% experience significant levels of  depressive symptoms. Distress reduces following abortion, but up to around 30% of  women are still experiencing emotional problems after a month. Women due to have  an abortion are more anxious and distressed than other pregnant women or women  whose pregnancy is threatened by miscarriage, but in the long term they do no  worse psychologically than women who give birth. Self-esteem appears unaffected  by the process. Less research has considered impact on the quality of  relationships and sexual functioning, but negative effects were reported by up to  20% of women. Conclusions were generally concordant with previous reviews.  However, anxiety symptoms are now clearly identified as the most common adverse  response. There has been increasing understanding of abortion as a potential  trauma, and studies less commonly explore guilt. The quality of studies has  improved, although there are still some methodological weaknesses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to study the impact of record linkage and different classification principles on maternal mortality rate. METHODS: The death  certificates of all fertile-aged women who died in 1987-94 in Finland (n = 9,192)  were linked to the Birth, Abortion, and Hospital Discharge Registers (n = 513,472  births, 93,807 induced abortions, and 71,701 other ended pregnancies) to identify  the women who had been pregnant during their last year of life. All deaths that  occurred up to 1 year after the end of pregnancy were classified according to  their connection to pregnancy. RESULTS: In total, 281 qualifying deaths were  found. Only in 22% of the death certificates was the pregnancy or its end  mentioned. The mortality rate was 41 per 100,000 registered ended pregnancies (27  for births, 48 for miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies, and 101 for abortions).  The maternal mortality rate depended greatly on which of these 281 cases were  defined as maternal deaths. The early maternal mortality rate varied between 5.6  and 6.8 per 100,000 live births, and the late maternal mortality rate between 0.6  and 2.5 depending on the definition used. The classification of other than direct  maternal deaths was ambiguous, especially in case of late cancers, cardio- and  cerebrovascular diseases, and early suicides. The official Finnish figure for  early maternal mortality (6.0/100,000 live births) seems to be a good estimate,  although only 65% of individual deaths were unambiguously classified.  CONCLUSIONS: Register linkage is necessary to identify late maternal deaths and  pregnancy-associated deaths. The current official classification of maternal  deaths as indirect, direct and fortuitous is arbitrary and allows much variation  in defining a maternal death.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists about whether abortion or childbirth is associated with greater psychological risks. We compared psychiatric admission rates of  women in time periods from 90 days to 4 years after either abortion or  childbirth. METHODS: We used California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) records of women aged  13-49 years at the time of either abortion or childbirth during 1989. Only women  who had no psychiatric admissions or pregnancy events during the year before the  target pregnancy event were included (n = 56 741). Psychiatric admissions were  examined using logistic regression analyses, controlling for age and months of  eligibility for Medi-Cal services. RESULTS: Overall, women who had had an  abortion had a significantly higher relative risk of psychiatric admission  compared with women who had delivered for every time period examined. Significant  differences by major diagnostic categories were found for adjustment reactions  (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-4.1), single-episode (OR  1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.9) and recurrent depressive psychosis (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.5),  and bipolar disorder (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.5-6.0). Significant differences were also  observed when the results were stratified by age. INTERPRETATION: Subsequent  psychiatric admissions are more common among low-income women who have an induced  abortion than among those who carry a pregnancy to term, both in the short and  longer term.

AU  - Ashton, J. R.
T2  - British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology
AB  - The psycho-social outcome of induced abortion was assessed in 64 women after eight weeks and in 86 women after eight months. Three groups were identified.  About 5 per cent had enduring, severe psychiatric disturbance following abortion.  Women especially at risk were those with a previous psychiatric or abnormal  obstetric history or with physical grounds for abortion and those expressing  ambivalence towards abortion. Short-lived disturbances affected about half of all  abortion patients. These symptoms included initial guilt and regrets and  sensitivity to the comments of people around them which relate to abortion. The  third group of women experienced no adverse sequelae. It is suggested that an  awareness of the risk factors should lead to the instigation of more adequate  counselling and support for those women who need it.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have considered whether elective and/or spontaneous abortion (EAB/SAB) may be risk factors for mental health sequelae in subsequent  pregnancy. This paper examines the impact of EAB/SAB on mental health during  subsequent pregnancy in a sample of women involved in a larger prospective study  of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the childbearing year (n=1,581).  METHODS: Women expecting their first baby completed standardized telephone  assessments including demographics, trauma history, PTSD, depression, and  pregnancy wantedness, and religiosity. RESULTS: Fourteen percent (n=221)  experienced a prior elective abortion (EAB), 13.1% (n=206) experienced a prior  spontaneous abortion (SAB), and 1.4% (n=22) experienced both. Of those women who  experienced either an EAB or SAB, 13.9% (n=220) appraised the EAB or SAB  experience as having been "a hard time" (i.e., potentially traumatic) and 32.6%  (n=132) rated it as their index trauma (i.e., their worst or second worst  lifetime exposure). Among the subset of 405 women with prior EAB or SAB, the rate  of PTSD during the subsequent pregnancy was 12.6% (n-51), the rate of depression  was 16.8% (n=68), and 5.4% (n-22) met criteria for both disorders. CONCLUSIONS:  History of sexual trauma predicted appraising the experience of EAB or SAB as "a  hard time." Wanting to be pregnant sooner was predictive of appraising the  experience of EAB or SAB as the worst or second worst (index) trauma. EAB or SAB  was appraised as less traumatic than sexual or medical trauma exposures and  conveyed relatively lower risk for PTSD. The patterns of predictors for  depression were similar.

AB  - CONTEXT: Credible research has not found any evidence that abortion causes mental disorders. It is not known, however, whether abortion-specific risk indicators  and other variables are associated with the incidence or recurrence of mental  disorders after abortion. METHODS: As part of a prospective cohort study  conducted in the Netherlands, 325 women were interviewed between April 2010 and  January 2011, between 20 and 40 days after having an abortion; 264 were followed  up an average of 2.7 years later. Associations between selected baseline  variables and postabortion incident or recurrent mental disorders among the 199  women at risk were investigated using bivariate and multivariate logistic  regression analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-two percent of women at risk of an incident  or recurrent mental disorder experienced one after the abortion. In multivariate  analyses, no abortion-related variables (e.g., history of multiple abortions,  second-trimester abortion, preabortion decision difficulty or uncertainty, and  postabortion negative emotions) were associated with experience of any  postabortion incident or recurrent mental disorders. The outcome was positively  associated with having conceived within an unstable relationship (odds ratio,  3.0), number of negative life events in the past year (1.4) and having a history  of mental disorders (2.4). CONCLUSIONS: Correlates of postabortion mental  disorders were variables that have been identified as general risk factors for  mental disorders, which supports the idea that abortion does not pose specific  risks to future mental health. Future research should investigate in what way  unstable relationships, adverse life events and psychiatric history affect  postabortion mental health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Twenty percent of pregnant women undergo an abortion. Reviews of previous studies on the effects of abortion on mental health have been  inconclusive. Little research has been carried out in this direction in our  country. AIMS: This study aims to study the psychological effects of abortions  and the associated sociodemographic and other parameters. SETTING AND DESIGN: It  is a cross-sectional study, conducted in five different government hospitals of  Hyderabad. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After identifying the participants, an  interview was conducted. First, sociodemographic and other parameters were  collected by an interviewer. Then, another interviewer conducted the interview  using diagnostic tools (Impact of Events Scale-Revised [IES-R] and Goldberg  Health Questionnaire-12 [GHQ-12]). Analysis was carried out using SPSS software.  RESULTS: Sixty cases of spontaneous abortion, 31 therapeutic and 9 elective  abortions, were collected. Overall, on GHQ-12, 57% women had no distress, 11% had  typical distress, while 14% had more than typical distress, 15% had psychological  distress, and 3% of them had severe distress. On IES-R, 16% women had little or  no symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD, 57% had several symptoms,  while 27% of them were likely to have PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: Women who underwent  elective abortion showed less distress than the other types. Those that underwent  a late abortion were more likely to suffer from psychological distress than those  having an early one. The medical history was a significant factor in determining  the mental health outcome of the women who underwent abortion.

AB  - A statistical association between a history of substance abuse and a history of abortion has been identified in several studies, but this association has not yet  been thoroughly analyzed. This study draws on a subset of data from a  reproductive history survey that included a nonparametric self-assessment of past  substance abuse distributed to a random sample of American women. Analysis of  this substance abuse variable showed that a report of substance abuse following a  first pregnancy was associated significantly with (a) abortion for all women, (b)  abortion for adolescents, and (c) abortion for women over 19 years of age. Women  who aborted a first pregnancy were five times more likely to report subsequent  substance abuse than women who carried to term, and they were four times more  likely to report substance abuse compared to those who suffered a natural loss of  their first pregnancy (i.e., due to miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or  stillbirth). Women with a history of abortion or a history of substance abuse  were significantly more likely to feel discomfort in responding to the survey.  The findings of this study have important implications for the design of future  studies examining substance abuse, adolescents, and women. These findings may  also have clinical and counseling implications.

AB  - Controversy over abortion inhibits recognition and treatment for women who experience psychological distress after abortion (PAD). This study identified the  characteristics, severity, and treatment preferences of university students who  experienced PAD. Of 151 females, 89 experienced an abortion. Psychological  outcomes were compared among those who preferred or did not prefer psychological  services after abortion to those who were never pregnant. All who had abortions  reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and grief lasting on  average 3 years. Yet, those who preferred services experienced heightened  psychological trauma indicative of partial or full PTSD (Impact of Event Scale, M  = 26.86 versus 16.84, p <â.05), perinatal grief (Perinatal Grief Scale, M 62.54  versus 50.89, p < 0.05), dysthymia (BDI M = 11.01 versus 9.28, p < 0.05), (M =  41.86 versus 39.36, p < 0.05), and co-existing mental health problems. PAD  appeared multi-factorial, associated with the abortion and overall emotional  health. Thus, psychological interventions for PAD need to be developed as a  public health priority.

This review focuses on psychological  aspects of contraception, unintended pregnancy, and abortion because these are  common reproductive health experiences in U.S. women's lives. This review  addresses the mental-health antecedents and consequences of these experiences,  mostly focusing on depression and depressive symptoms before and after unintended  pregnancy and contraception. As mental-health antecedents, depressive symptoms  predict contraceptive behaviors that lead to unintended pregnancy, and  mental-health disorders have been associated with having subsequent abortions. In  examining the mental-health consequences, most sound research does not find  abortion or contraceptive use to cause mental-health problems. Consequently,  evidence does not support policies based on the notion that abortion harms  women's mental health. Nevertheless, the abortion-care setting may be a place to  integrate mental-health services. In contrast, women who have births resulting  from unintended pregnancies may be at higher risk of postpartum depression.  Social policies (e.g., paid maternity leave, subsidized child care) may protect  women from mental-health problems and stress of unplanned children interrupting  employment, education, and pre-existing family care responsibilities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a first abortion increases risk of mental health disorders compared with a first childbirth with and without considering  prepregnancy mental health and adverse exposures, childhood economic status,  miscarriage history, age at first abortion or childbirth, and race or ethnicity.  METHODS: A cohort study compared rates of mental disorders (anxiety, mood,  impulse-control, substance use, eating disorders, and suicidal ideation) among  259 women postabortion and 677 women postchildbirth aged 18-42 years at the time  of interview from The National Comorbidity Survey-Replication. RESULTS: The  percentage of women with no, one, two, and three or more mental health disorders  before their first abortion was 37.8%, 19.7%, 15.2%, and 27.3% and before their  first childbirth was 57.9%, 19.6%, 9.2%, and 13.3%, respectively, indicating that  women in the abortion group had more prior mental health disorders than women in  the childbirth group (P<.001). Although in unadjusted Cox proportional hazard  models, abortion compared with childbirth was associated with statistically  significant higher hazards of postpregnancy mental health disorders, associations  were reduced and became nonstatistically significant for five disorders after  adjusting for the aforementioned factors. Hazard ratios and associated 95%  confidence intervals dropped from 1.52 (1.08-2.15) to 1.12 (0.87-1.46) for  anxiety disorders; from 1.56 (1.23-1.98) to 1.18 (0.88-1.56) for mood disorders;  from 1.62 (1.02-2.57) to 1.10 (0.75-1.62) for impulse-control disorders; from  2.53 (1.09-5.86) to 1.82 (0.63-5.25) for eating disorders; and from 1.62  (1.09-2.40) to 1.25 (0.88-1.78) for suicidal ideation. Only the relationship  between abortion and substance use disorders remained statistically significant,  although the hazard ratio dropped from 3.05 (1.94-4.79) to 2.30 (1.35-3.92).  CONCLUSIONS: After accounting for confounding factors, abortion was not a  statistically significant predictor of subsequent anxiety, mood, impulse-control,  and eating disorders or suicidal ideation. LEVEL OF EVEDIENCE: II.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent evidence has linked induced abortion with later adverse psychiatric outcomes in young women. AIMS: To examine whether abortion or  miscarriage are associated with subsequent psychiatric and substance use  disorders. METHOD: A sample (n=1223) of women from a cohort born between 1981 and  1984 in Australia were assessed at 21 years for psychiatric and substance use  disorders and lifetime pregnancy histories. RESULTS: Young women reporting a  pregnancy loss had nearly three times the odds of experiencing a lifetime illicit  drug disorder (excluding cannabis): abortion odds ratio (OR)=3.6 (95% CI 2.0-6.7)  and miscarriage OR=2.6 (95% CI 1.2-5.4). Abortion was associated with alcohol use  disorder (OR=2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.5) and 12-month depression (OR=1.9, 95% CI  1.1-3.1). CONCLUSIONS: These findings add to the growing body of evidence  suggesting that pregnancy loss per se, whether abortion or miscarriage, increases  the risk of a range of substance use disorders and affective disorders in young  women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypercortisolaemia is associated with certain depressive disorders. Mifepristone has possible antidepressant properties related to its  anti-glucocorticoid activity. To explore the possible mood effects of  mifepristone, we examined the mood outcomes after surgical and medical  (mifepristone-misoprostol) abortion. The objectives were to determine  post-abortion depression risk, evaluate risk factors for post-abortion depression  and to explore the relationship between cortisol and depression. METHODS: We  enrolled 47 surgical and 31 medical abortion patients. Women were assessed  pre-abortion and 1 month post-abortion with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression  Scale (EPDS) and salivary cortisol levels. RESULTS: Pre-abortion, 36% (17/47) of  surgical and 35% (11/31) of medical patients had high depression risk (EPDS > or  = 10; (chi(2) = 0.31, df = 1, P = 0.58). At follow-up, 17% (7/42) of surgical and  21% (5/24) of medical patients had an EPDS > or = 10 (chi(2) = 0.18, df = 1, P =  0.67). The decline post-abortion in the women with EPDS > or = 10 was significant  (P = 0.01). Women with past psychiatric history (Fisher's exact P = 0.05) or  anxiety disorders (Fisher's exact P = 0.005) had elevated risk for post-abortion  depression. Change in cortisol levels was not correlated with change in EPDS (r =  0.10, P = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients experienced post-abortion mood  improvement. Mifepristone did not offer additional antidepressant effects. The  lack of correlation between cortisol and depression could represent  hypersuppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis or insufficient  mifepristone dose to alter HPA axis activity.

AB  - Using data from the United States National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) and the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), we conducted secondary data analyses to  examine the relationship of abortion, including multiple abortions, to anxiety  after first pregnancy outcome in two studies. First, when analyzing the NSFG, we  found that pre-pregnancy anxiety symptoms, rape history, age at first pregnancy  outcome (abortion vs. delivery), race, marital status, income, education,  subsequent abortions, and subsequent deliveries accounted for a significant  association initially found between first pregnancy outcome and experiencing  subsequent anxiety symptoms. We then tested the relationship of abortion to  clinically diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress  disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder, using NCS data. Contrary to  findings from our analyses of the NSFG, in the NCS analyses we did not find a  significant relationship between first pregnancy outcome and subsequent rates of  GAD, social anxiety, or PTSD. However, multiple abortions were found to be  associated with much higher rates of PTSD and social anxiety; this relationship  was largely explained by pre-pregnancy mental health disorders and their  association with higher rates of violence. Researchers and clinicians need to  learn more about the relations of violence exposure, mental health, and pregnancy  outcome to avoid attributing poor mental health solely to pregnancy outcomes.

TI  - Depression and termination of pregnancy (induced abortion) in a national cohort of young Australian women: the confounding effect of women's experience of  violence.
AU  - Taft, Angela J.
AU  - Watson, Lyndsey F.
T2  - BMC public health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Termination of pregnancy is a common and safe medical procedure in countries where it is legal. One in four Australian women terminates a pregnancy,  most often when young. There is inconclusive evidence about whether pregnancy  termination affects women's rates of depression. There is evidence of a strong  association between partner violence and depression. Our objective was to examine  the associations with depression of women's experience of violence, pregnancy  termination, births and socio-demographic characteristics, among a  population-based sample of young Australian women. METHODS: The data from the  Younger cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health comprised  14,776 women aged 18-23 in Survey I (1996) of whom 9683 aged 22-27 also responded  to Survey 2 (2000). With linked data, we distinguished terminations, violence and  depression reported before and after 1996.We used logistic regression to examine  the association of depression (CES-D 10) as both a dichotomous and linear measure  in 2000 with pregnancy termination, numbers of births and with violence  separately and then in mutually adjusted models with sociodemographic variables.  RESULTS: 30% of young women were depressed. Eleven percent (n = 1076) reported a  termination by 2000. A first termination before 1996 and between 1996 and 2000  were both associated with depression in a univariate model (OR 1.37, 95%CI 1.12  to 1.66; OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.24 to 1.87). However, after adjustment for violence,  numbers of births and sociodemographic variables (OR 1.22, 95%CI 0.99 to 1.51)  this became only marginally significant, a similar association with having two or  more births (1.26, 95%CI. 1.00 to 1.58). In contrast, any form of violence but  especially that of partner violence in 1996 or 2000, was significantly associated  with depression: in univariate (OR 2.31, 95%CI 1.97 to 2.70 or 2.45, 95% CI 1.99  to 3.04) and multivariate models (AOR 2.06, 95%CI 1.74 to 2.43 or 2.12, 95%CI  1.69 to 2.65). Linear regression showed a four fold greater effect of violence  than termination or births. CONCLUSION: Violence, especially partner violence,  makes a significantly greater contribution to women's depression compared with  pregnancy termination or births. Any strategy to reduce the burden of women's  depression should include prevention or reduction of violence against women and  strengthening women's sexual and reproductive health to ensure that pregnancies  are planned and wanted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been continued interest in the extent to which women have positive and negative reactions to abortion. AIMS: To document emotional  reactions to abortion, and to examine the links between reactions to abortion and  subsequent mental health outcomes. METHOD: Data were gathered on the pregnancy  and mental health history of a birth cohort of over 500 women studied to the age  of 30. RESULTS: Abortion was associated with high rates of both positive and  negative emotional reactions; however, nearly 90% of respondents believed that  the abortion was the right decision. Analyses showed that the number of negative  responses to the abortion was associated with increased levels of subsequent  mental health disorders (P<0.05). Further analyses suggested that, after  adjustment for confounding, those having an abortion and reporting negative  reactions had rates of mental health disorders that were approximately 1.4-1.8  times higher than those not having an abortion. CONCLUSIONS: Abortion was  associated with both positive and negative emotional reactions. The extent of  negative emotional reactions appeared to modify the links between abortion and  subsequent mental health problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Concern has been expressed about potential harm to women's mental health in association with having an induced abortion, but it remains unclear  whether induced abortion is associated with an increased risk of subsequent  psychiatric problems. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study that  involved linking information from the Danish Civil Registration system to the  Danish Psychiatric Central Register and the Danish National Register of Patients.  The information consisted of data for girls and women with no record of mental  disorders during the 1995-2007 period who had a first-trimester induced abortion  or a first childbirth during that period. We estimated the rates of first-time  psychiatric contact (an inpatient admission or outpatient visit) for any type of  mental disorder within the 12 months after the abortion or childbirth as compared  with the 9-month period preceding the event. RESULTS: The incidence rates of  first psychiatric contact per 1000 person-years among girls and women who had a  first abortion were 14.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.7 to 15.6) before  abortion and 15.2 (95% CI, 14.4 to 16.1) after abortion. The corresponding rates  among girls and women who had a first childbirth were 3.9 (95% CI, 3.7 to 4.2)  before delivery and 6.7 (95% CI, 6.4 to 7.0) post partum. The relative risk of a  psychiatric contact did not differ significantly after abortion as compared with  before abortion (P = 0.19) but did increase after childbirth as compared with  before childbirth (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The finding that the incidence rate  of psychiatric contact was similar before and after a first-trimester abortion  does not support the hypothesis that there is an increased risk of mental  disorders after a first-trimester induced abortion.

AB  - The primary aim of this study was to compare the experience of an early abortion (1st trimester) to a late abortion (2nd and 3rd trimester) relative to  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms after controlling for  socio-demographic and personal history variables. Online surveys were completed  by 374 women who experienced either a 1st trimester abortion (up to 12 weeks  gestation) or a 2nd or 3rd trimester abortion (13 weeks gestation or beyond).  Most respondents (81%) were U.S. citizens. Later abortions were associated with  higher Intrusion subscale scores and with a greater likelihood of reporting  disturbing dreams, reliving of the abortion, and trouble falling asleep.  Reporting the pregnancy was desired by one's partner, experiencing pressure to  abort, having left the partner prior to the abortion, not disclosing the abortion  to the partner, and physical health concerns were more common among women who  received later abortions. Social reasons for the abortion were linked with  significantly higher PTSD total and subscale scores for the full sample. Women  who postpone their abortions may need more active professional intervention  before securing an abortion based on the increased risks identified herein. More  research with diverse samples employing additional measures of mental illness is  needed.

T2  - Women & health
AB  - This study examined demographic characteristics, available resources, and mental health outcomes of women who did and did not consider abortion in pregnancy.  Using data collected between 1998 and 2000 from 2,937 mothers recruited for the  Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study, this study examined whether women  who did and did not consider abortion differed in terms of sociodemographic  characteristics and resources at the birth of their children and mental health  outcomes when their children were one year old. This study further examined  protective factors associated with low parenting stress at one year postpartum,  despite initial abortion consideration. Compared to women who did not consider  abortion, women who did consider abortion tended to be younger, have less  education and lower income, and report higher levels of substance use, higher  perceived support, and lower received support. A subset of women who had higher  education, more income, and lower substance use reported lower parenting stress  at year one despite abortion consideration in pregnancy. Promotion of education  and employment assistance may be particularly important among women experiencing  unplanned pregnancies as these services may contribute to lower parenting stress  and improved child outcomes.

AB  - A survey of women patients in the practices of family physicians in Victoria, B.C. was undertaken to determine the factors associated with pregnancy losses and  their effect on women's health. Questionnaires returned by 1428 women with 2961  pregnancies showed that a higher number of losses, particularly abortions,  correlates both with poor health and the need to obtain professional help in  dealing with the loss(es). Partner support appears to be one of the most  important factors in maintaining a pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate a person-centered abortion care mobile-based intervention on perceived social stigma, social  support, mental health and post-abortion care experiences among Kenyan women who  received abortion services at private clinics. METHODS: This randomized  controlled study enrolled women who obtained an abortion from private clinics in  Nairobi county, Kenya and randomized them into one of three study arms: 1)  standard of care (follow-up by service provider call center); 2) post-abortion  phone follow-up by a peer counselor (a woman who has had an abortion herself and  is trained in person-centered abortion care); or 3) post-abortion phone follow-up  by a nurse (a nurse who is trained in person-centered abortion care). All  participants were followed-up at two- and four-weeks post-abortion to evaluate  intervention effects on mental health, social support, and abortion-related  stigma scores. A Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test was used to assess the effect  of each intervention compared to the control group. In total, 371 women  participated at baseline and were each randomized to the study arms. RESULTS:  Using Kruskal-Wallis tests, the nurse arm improved mental health scores from  baseline to week two; however this was only marginally significant (p = 0.059).  The nurse arm also lowered stigma scores from baseline to week four, and this was  marginally significant (p = 0.099). No other differences were found between the  study arms. This person-centered mobile phone-based intervention may improve  mental health and decrease perceived stigma among Kenyan women who received  abortion services in private clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses trained in  person-centered abortion care, in particular, may improve women's experiences  post-abortion and potentially reduce feelings of shame and stigma and improve  mental health in this context.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We set out to assess the occurrence of new depression and anxiety diagnoses in women 3 years after they sought an abortion. METHODS: We conducted  semiannual telephone interviews of 956 women who sought abortions from 30 US  facilities. Adjusted multivariable discrete-time logistic survival models  examined whether the study group (women who obtained abortions just under a  facility's gestational age limit, who were denied abortions and carried to term,  who were denied abortions and did not carry to term, and who received  first-trimester abortions) predicted depression or anxiety onset during seven  6-month time intervals. RESULTS: The 3-year cumulative probability of  professionally diagnosed depression was 9% to 14%; for anxiety it was 10% to 15%,  with no study group differences. Women in the first-trimester group and women  denied abortions who did not give birth had greater odds of new self-diagnosed  anxiety than did women who obtained abortions just under facility gestational  limits. CONCLUSIONS: Among women seeking abortions near facility gestational  limits, those who obtained abortions were at no greater mental health risk than  were women who carried an unwanted pregnancy to term.

T2  - Perspectives on sexual and reproductive health
AB  - CONTEXT: A 2008 report by the American Psychological Association found no evidence that an induced abortion causes mental health problems in adult women.  No conclusions were drawn with respect to adolescents because of a scarcity of  evidence. METHODS: Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health  were used to examine whether abortion in adolescence was associated with  subsequent depression and low self-esteem. In all, 289 female respondents  reported at least one pregnancy between Wave 1 (1994-1995) and Wave 2 (1996) of  the survey. Of these, 69 reported an induced abortion. Population-averaged lagged  logistic regression models were used to assess associations between abortion and  depression and low self-esteem within a year of the pregnancy and approximately  five years later, at Wave 3 (2001-2002). RESULTS: Abortion was not associated  with depression or low self-esteem at either time point. Socioeconomic and  demographic characteristics did not substantially modify the relationships  between abortion and the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents who have an abortion  do not appear to be at elevated risk for depression or low self-esteem in the  short term or up to five years after the abortion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to compare grief resolution after dilation and evacuation (D&E) or induction of labor (IOL) for second-trimester pregnancy  termination. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort of 49 women choosing  second-trimester abortion caused by fetal anomalies by either medical IOL or D&E.  Depression was evaluated by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and  bereavement was assessed by using the Perinatal Grief Scale with follow-up to 12  months after pregnancy termination. Data were analyzed with chi 2 tests,  Mann-Whitney U tests, and independent and paired sample t tests. RESULTS: There  was no significant difference in depression incidence on enrollment (61.9% D&E,  53.8% IOL, P = .579), at 4 months (23.5% D&E, 14.3% IOL, P = .252) or 12 months  (27.3% D&E, 20.0% IOL, P = .696) or on the PGS at 4 months (74.1 vs 90.2, P =  .351) or 12 months (73.3 vs 86.4, P = .658). CONCLUSION: There is no significant  difference in grief resolution among women who terminate a desired pregnancy by  either medical or surgical abortion.

AB  - Termination of pregnancy after diagnosis of fetal anomaly (TOPFA) is a contested issue and stigma may negatively impact affected women's psychological reactions.  This study examined the influence of perceived and internalized stigma on women's  long-term adjustment to a TOPFA. One hundred forty-eight women whose TOPFA dated  back 1 to 7Â years responded to self-report questionnaires. The associations  between perceived stigma at the time of the TOPFA, current internalized stigma  and symptoms of grief, trauma and depression were modeled using multiple linear  regression. The proportion of participants reporting scores above the cutoffs on  the respective scale was 17.6% for grief, 18.9% for posttraumatic stress, and  10.8% for depression. After controlling for time since the TOPFA, pre-TOPFA  mental health and obstetric variables, higher levels of current internalized  stigma were related to higher levels of grief, trauma, and depression. Mediation  analyses suggested that the effect of perceived stigma at the time of the TOPFA  on symptoms of grief and trauma was mediated by current internalized stigma, but  the cross-sectional design limited causal interpretation of results. Internalized  stigma is associated with long-term psychological distress following a TOPFA.  Perceived stigma at the time of the TOPFA may contribute to increased trauma and  grief symptomatology, but results need to be validated in longitudinal studies.  Health care providers and public initiatives should aim at reducing stigma among  affected women.

TI  - Abortion, substance abuse and mental health in early adulthood: Thirteen-year longitudinal evidence from the United States.
AU  - Sullins, Donald Paul
T2  - SAGE open medicine
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the links between pregnancy outcomes (birth, abortion, or involuntary pregnancy loss) and mental health outcomes for US women during the  transition into adulthood to determine the extent of increased risk, if any,  associated with exposure to induced abortion. METHOD: Panel data on pregnancy  history and mental health history for a nationally representative cohort of 8005  women at (average) ages 15, 22, and 28âyears from the National Longitudinal Study  of Adolescent to Adult Health were examined for risk of depression, anxiety,  suicidal ideation, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, cannabis abuse, and nicotine  dependence by pregnancy outcome (birth, abortion, and involuntary pregnancy  loss). Risk ratios were estimated for time-dynamic outcomes from  population-averaged longitudinal logistic and Poisson regression models. RESULTS:  After extensive adjustment for confounding, other pregnancy outcomes, and  sociodemographic differences, abortion was consistently associated with increased  risk of mental health disorder. Overall risk was elevated 45% (risk ratio, 1.45;  95% confidence interval, 1.30-1.62; pâ<â0.0001). Risk of mental health disorder  with pregnancy loss was mixed, but also elevated 24% (risk ratio, 1.24; 95%  confidence interval, 1.13-1.37; pâ<â0.0001) overall. Birth was weakly associated  with reduced mental disorders. One-eleventh (8.7%; 95% confidence interval,  6.0-11.3) of the prevalence of mental disorders examined over the period were  attributable to abortion. CONCLUSION: Evidence from the United States confirms  previous findings from Norway and New Zealand that, unlike other pregnancy  outcomes, abortion is consistently associated with a moderate increase in risk of  mental health disorders during late adolescence and early adulthood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study prospectively assesses the mental health outcomes among women seeking abortions, by comparing women having later abortions with women  denied abortions, up to 2 years post-abortion seeking. METHOD: We present the  first 2 years of a 5-year telephone interview study that is following 956 women  who sought an abortion from 30 facilities throughout the USA. We use adjusted  linear mixed-effects regression analyses to assess whether symptoms of depression  and anxiety, as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory-short form and the  Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire, differ  over time among women denied an abortion due to advanced gestational age,  compared with women who received abortions. RESULTS: Baseline predicted mean  depressive symptom scores for women denied abortion (3.07) were similar to women  receiving an abortion just below the gestational limit (2.86). Depressive  symptoms declined over time, with no difference between groups. Initial predicted  mean anxiety symptoms were higher among women denied care (2.59) than among women  who had an abortion just below the gestational limit (1.91). Anxiety levels in  the two groups declined and converged after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Women who  received an abortion had similar or lower levels of depression and anxiety than  women denied an abortion. Our findings do not support the notion that abortion is  a cause of mental health problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The extent to which abortion has harmful consequences for mental health remains controversial. We aimed to examine the linkages between having an  abortion and mental health outcomes over the interval from age 15-25 years.  METHODS: Data were gathered as part of the Christchurch Health and Development  Study, a 25-year longitudinal study of a birth cohort of New Zealand children.  Information was obtained on: a) the history of pregnancy/abortion for female  participants over the interval from 15-25 years; b) measures of DSM-IV mental  disorders and suicidal behaviour over the intervals 15-18, 18-21 and 21-25 years;  and c) childhood, family and related confounding factors. RESULTS: Forty-one  percent of women had become pregnant on at least one occasion prior to age 25,  with 14.6% having an abortion. Those having an abortion had elevated rates of  subsequent mental health problems including depression, anxiety, suicidal  behaviours and substance use disorders. This association persisted after  adjustment for confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that  abortion in young women may be associated with increased risks of mental health  problems.

T2  - Psychology, public policy, and law : an official law review of the University of Arizona College of Law and the University of Miami School of Law
AB  - The authors tested the Supreme Court's assumption that minors are particularly susceptible to psychological distress following abortion. The responses of 38  minors (age < 18 years) were compared with those of 402 adults, 1 month and 2  years after an elective, 1st-trimester abortion. Minors were relatively less  satisfied with their abortion decision and felt less benefit from the abortion  than did adults 1 month postabortion, but they did not differ from adults in  adjustment 2 years postabortion. Minors were not more depressed than adults at  either time period, and their decision satisfaction and perceived benefit at both  time periods did not suggest a population at risk. Age group differences in  adjustment 1 month postabortion were explained by minors' reduced self-efficacy  appraisals for coping, greater use of avoidant coping strategies, and greater  perceived parental conflict. These findings challenge the Court's assumption that  minors are particularly vulnerable to psychological harm following abortion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated whether reported psychiatric morbidity was increased after termination of pregnancy compared with other outcomes of an unplanned  pregnancy. METHOD: This was a prospective cohort study of 13,261 women with an  unplanned pregnancy. Psychiatric morbidity reported by GPs after the conclusion  of the pregnancy was compared in four groups: women who had a termination of  pregnancy (6410), women who did not request a termination (6151), women who were  refused a termination (379), and women who changed their minds before the  termination was performed (321). RESULTS: Rates of total reported psychiatric  disorder were no higher after termination of pregnancy than after childbirth.  Women with a previous history of psychiatric illness were most at risk of  disorder after the end of their pregnancy, whatever its outcome. Women without a  previous history of psychosis had an apparently lower risk of psychosis after  termination than postpartum (relative risk RR = 0.4, 95% confidence interval CI =  0.3-0.7), but rates of psychosis leading to hospital admission were similar. In  women with no previous history of psychiatric illness, deliberate self-harm (DSH)  was more common in those who had a termination (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6), or who  were refused a termination (RR 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.3). CONCLUSIONS: The findings on  DSH are probably explicable by confounding variables, such as adverse social  factors, associated both with the request for termination and with subsequent  self-harm. No overall increase in reported psychiatric morbidity was found.

AB  - This study examined the stigma of abortion and psychological implications of concealment among 442 women followed for 2 years from the day of their abortion.  As predicted, women who felt stigmatized by abortion were more likely to feel a  need to keep it a secret from family and friends. Secrecy was related positively  to suppressing thoughts of the abortion and negatively to disclosing  abortion-related emotions to others. Greater thought suppression was associated  with experiencing more intrusive thoughts of the abortion. Both suppression and  intrusive thoughts, in turn, were positively related to increases in  psychological distress over time. Emotional disclosure moderated the association  between intrusive thoughts and distress. Disclosure was associated with decreases  in distress among women experiencing intrusive thoughts of their abortion, but  was unrelated to distress among women not experiencing intrusive thoughts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists over psychological risks associated with abortion. The objectives of this study were to examine women's emotions, evaluations, and  mental health after an abortion, as well as changes over time in these responses  and their predictors. METHODS: Women arriving at 1 of 3 sites for an abortion of  a first-trimester unintended pregnancy were randomly approached to participate in  a longitudinal study with 4 assessments-1 hour before the abortion, and 1 hour, 1  month, and 2 years after the abortion. Eight hundred eighty-two (85%) of 1043  eligible women approached agreed; 442 (50%) of 882 were followed for 2 years.  Preabortion and postabortion depression and self-esteem, postabortion emotions,  decision satisfaction, perceived harm and benefit, and posttraumatic stress  disorder were assessed. Demographic variables and prior mental health were  examined as predictors of postabortion psychological responses. RESULTS: Two  years postabortion, 301 (72%) of 418 women were satisfied with their decision;  306 (69%) of 441 said they would have the abortion again; 315 (72%) of 440  reported more benefit than harm from their abortion; and 308 (80%) of 386 were  not depressed. Six (1%) of 442 reported posttraumatic stress disorder. Depression  decreased and self-esteem increased from preabortion to postabortion, but  negative emotions increased and decision satisfaction decreased over time.  Prepregnancy history of depression was a risk factor for depression, lower  self-esteem, and more negative abortion-specific outcomes 2 years postabortion.  Younger age and having more children preabortion also predicted more negative  abortion evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: Most women do not experience psychological  problems or regret their abortion 2 years postabortion, but some do. Those who do  tend to be women with a prior history of depression.

TI  - Depression and unwanted first pregnancy: longitudinal cohort study.
AU  - Schmiege, Sarah
AU  - Russo, Nancy Felipe
T2  - BMJ (Clinical research ed.)
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the outcomes of an unwanted first pregnancy (abortion v live delivery) and risk of depression and to explain discrepancies with previous  research that used the same dataset. DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING:  Nationally representative sample of US men and women aged 14-24 in 1979.  PARTICIPANTS: 1247 women in the US national longitudinal survey of youth who  aborted or delivered an unwanted first pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical  cut-off and continuous scores on a 1992 measure of the Center for Epidemiological  Studies depression scale. RESULTS: Terminating compared with delivering an  unwanted first pregnancy was not directly related to risk of clinically  significant depression (odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.66).  No evidence was found of a relation between pregnancy outcome and depression in  analyses of subgroups known to vary in under-reporting of abortion. In analyses  of the characteristics of non-respondents, refusal to provide information on  abortion did not explain the lack of detecting a relation between abortion and  mental health. The abortion group had a significantly higher mean education and  income and lower total family size, all of which were associated with a lower  risk of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence that choosing to terminate rather than  deliver an unwanted first pregnancy puts women at higher risk of depression is  inconclusive. Discrepancies between current findings and those of previous  research using the same dataset primarily reflect differences in coding of a  first pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most previous studies that have investigated the relation between abortion and mental illness have presented mixed findings. We examined the  relation between abortion, mental disorders, and suicidality using a US  nationally representative sample. METHODS: Data came from the National  Comorbidity Survey Replication (n = 3310 women, aged 18 years and older). The  World Health Organization-Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used  to assess mental disorders based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of  Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria and lifetime abortion in women.  Multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to examine associations  between abortion and lifetime mood, anxiety, substance use, eating, and  disruptive behaviour disorders, as well as suicidal ideation and suicide  attempts. We calculated the percentage of respondents whose mental disorder came  after the first abortion. The role of violence was also explored. Population  attributable fractions were calculated for significant associations between  abortion and mental disorders. RESULTS: After adjusting for sociodemographics,  abortion was associated with an increased likelihood of several mental  disorders--mood disorders (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] ranging from 1.75 to 1.91),  anxiety disorders (AOR ranging from 1.87 to 1.91), substance use disorders (AOR  ranging from 3.14 to 4.99), as well as suicidal ideation and suicide attempts  (AOR ranging from 1.97 to 2.18). Adjusting for violence weakened some of these  associations. For all disorders examined, less than one-half of women reported  that their mental disorder had begun after the first abortion. Population  attributable fractions ranged from 5.8% (suicidal ideation) to 24.7% (drug  abuse). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms a strong association between abortion and  mental disorders. Possible mechanisms of this relation are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research on the links between abortion and mental health has been limited by design problems and relatively weak evidence. AIMS: To examine the  links between pregnancy outcomes and mental health outcomes. METHOD: Data were  gathered on the pregnancy and mental health history of a birth cohort of over 500  women studied to the age of 30. RESULTS: After adjustment for confounding,  abortion was associated with a small increase in the risk of mental disorders;  women who had had abortions had rates of mental disorder that were about 30%  higher. There were no consistent associations between other pregnancy outcomes  and mental health. Estimates of attributable risk indicated that exposure to  abortion accounted for 1.5% to 5.5% of the overall rate of mental disorders.  CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is consistent with the view that abortion may be  associated with a small increase in risk of mental disorders. Other pregnancy  outcomes were not related to increased risk of mental health problems.

TI  - Abortion and depression: a population-based longitudinal study of young women.
AU  - Pedersen, Willy
T2  - Scandinavian journal of public health
AB  - AIM: Induced abortion is an experience shared by a large number of women in Norway, but we know little about the likely social or mental health-related  implications of undergoing induced abortion. International studies suggest an  increased risk of adverse outcomes such as depression, but many studies are  weakened by poor design. One particular problem is the lack of control for  confounding factors likely to increase the risk of both abortion and depression.  The aim of the study was to investigate whether induced abortion was a risk  factor for subsequent depression. METHODS: A representative sample of women from  the normal population (n=768) was monitored between the ages of 15 and 27 years.  Questions covered depression, induced abortion and childbirth, as well as  sociodemographic variables, family relationships and a number of individual  characteristics, such as schooling and occupational history and conduct problems.  RESULTS: Young women who reported having had an abortion in their twenties were  more likely to score above the cut-off point for depression (odds ratio (OR) 3.5;  95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-6.1). Controlling for third variables reduced  the association, but it remained significant (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.7-5.6). There was  no association between teenage abortion and subsequent depression. CONCLUSIONS:  Young adult women who undergo induced abortion may be at increased risk for  subsequent depression.

AB  - Sixty-seven women were interviewed four weeks after spontaneous abortion. As determined by the Present State Examination, 32 of these women were psychiatric  cases. This rate is four times higher than in the general population of women. In  each case the diagnosis was depressive disorder, a finding confirmed by scores on  three depression rating scales. Many women showed typical features of grief.  Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with a history of previous  spontaneous abortion, and less so with childlessness.

Emotional  consequences of the abortion were evaluated by before-and-after comparisons of  the same measures in a subgroup of the aborting women. Findings indicated  significantly greater distress in the aborting women, with lower levels after the  abortion. The effects on emotional well-being of personal and contextual factors  and their interactions were also examined.

AU  - Steinberg, Julia R.
AU  - Finer, Lawrence B.
T2  - Social science & medicine (1982)
AB  - Using the US National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), Coleman, Coyle, Shuping, and Rue (2009) published an analysis indicating that compared to women who had never had  an abortion, women who had reported an abortion were at an increased risk of  several anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders. Here, we show that those  results are not replicable. That is, using the same data, sample, and codes as  indicated by those authors, it is not possible to replicate the simple bivariate  statistics testing the relationship of ever having had an abortion to each mental  health disorder when no factors were controlled for in analyses (Table 2 in  Coleman etÂ al., 2009). Furthermore, among women with prior pregnancies in the  NCS, we investigated whether having zero, one, or multiple abortions (abortion  history) was associated with having a mood, anxiety, or substance use disorder at  the time of the interview. In doing this, we tested two competing frameworks: the  abortion-as-trauma versus the common-risk-factors approach. Our results support  the latter framework. In the bivariate context when no other factors were  included in models, abortion history was not related to having a mood disorder,  but it was related to having an anxiety or substance use disorder. When prior  mental health and violence experience were controlled in our models, no  significant relation was found between abortion history and anxiety disorders.  When these same risk factors and other background factors were controlled, women  who had multiple abortions remained at an increased risk of having a substance  use disorder compared to women who had no abortions, likely because we were  unable to control for other risk factors associated with having an abortion and  substance use. Policy, practice, and research should focus on assisting women at  greatest risk of having unintended pregnancies and having poor mental  health-those with violence in their lives and prior mental health problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Only few studies have been carried out on the relationship between pregnancy and deaths from external causes. METHODS: Information on deaths from  external causes among women aged 15-49 years in Finland in 1987-2000 (n = 5299)  was linked to three national health registers to identify pregnancy-associated  deaths (n = 212). RESULTS: The mortality rate for women during pregnancy and  within 1 year of pregnancy termination from external causes was lower than  mortality from external causes among non-pregnant women (relative risk 0.79; 95%  confidence interval 0.69-0.91). Owing to elevated suicide and homicide rates,  however, an increased risk was observed for women after abortions, especially in  the age group of 15-24 years. CONCLUSIONS: The low rate of deaths from external  causes suggests the protective effect of childbirth, but the elevated risk after  a terminated pregnancy needs to be recognized in the provision of health care and  social services.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess whether younger adolescents experience greater adverse psychological outcomes after abortion than those aged 18-21 years, whether  abortion places all adolescents at risk for negative sequelae, and what factors  predict negative outcomes. METHODS: A total of 96 young women aged 14-21 years  seeking counseling for unwanted pregnancies at four clinics completed  questionnaires after counseling. These included the Beck Depression Inventory  (BDI), an emotion scale, questions regarding sociodemographic and reproductive  background, feelings about pregnancy, and decision-making. Sixty-three  respondents were reinterviewed 4 weeks postabortion and completed the BDI,  emotion scale, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale,  Impact of Events Scale, and Positive States of Mind Scale. Chi-squares and  Student's t-tests were used to compare: (a) responses of adolescents under 18  years of age with those 18-21 years, (b) preabortion and postabortion responses,  and (c) the current sample with other samples of adolescents. RESULTS:  Adolescents under age 18 years were less comfortable with their decision, but  showed no other differences compared with those aged 18-21 years. Both groups  showed significant improvement in psychological responses postabortion.  Postabortion scores did not differ significantly from those of other adolescent  samples reported in the literature. Preabortion emotional state and perception of  partner pressure predicted postabortion response. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its legal  significance, age 18 years was not a meaningful cutoff point for psychological  response to abortion in this sample. There was no evidence that abortion poses a  threat to adolescents' psychological well-being.

AU  - Pedersen, Willy
T2  - Addiction (Abingdon, England)
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the possible linkages between deliveries, abortions and subsequent nicotine dependence, alcohol problems and use of cannabis and other  illegal drugs from the ages of 15-27 years. METHODS: Data were gathered as part  of the Young in Norway Longitudinal Study, an 11-year follow-up of a  representative sample of Norwegian adolescents and young adults. DESIGN, SETTING  AND PARTICIPANTS: Information was obtained on (i) the history of childbirths and  induced abortions for the participants between the ages of 15-27 years; (ii)  measures of nicotine dependence, alcohol problems and use of cannabis and other  illegal drugs; and (iii) socio-demographic, family and individual confounding  factors. RESULTS: Those who had had an abortion had elevated rates of substance  use and problems. Those who gave birth to a child had reduced rates of alcohol  problems and cannabis use. These associations persisted after control for  confounders. However, those women who still lived with the father of the aborted  fetus were not at increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: Abortion in women may, under some  circumstances, be associated with increased risk of nicotine dependence, alcohol  problems and use of cannabis and other illegal drugs. The birth of a child may  reduce the use of some substances.

AB  - Sleep disorders are linked with mood disorders and other psychiatric illnesses. Many women attribute sleep difficulties to abortion, but this self-diagnosis has  not been tested using record-based evidence. Examination of records for 56,824  women with no known history of sleep disorders or sleep disturbances revealed  that women were more likely to be treated for sleep disorders or disturbances  following an induced abortion compared to a birth. The difference was most  pronounced in the first 180 days after pregnancy resolution and was not  significant after the third year.

AB  - In this record-based study, rates of 1st-time outpatient mental health treatment for 4 years following an abortion or a birth among women receiving medical  assistance through the state of California were compared. After controlling for  preexisting psychological difficulties, age, months of eligibility, and the  number of pregnancies, the rate of care was 17% higher for the abortion group (n  = 14,297) in comparison with the birth group (n = 40,122). Within 90 days after  the pregnancy, the abortion group had 63% more claims than the birth group, with  the percentages equaling 42%, 30%, and 16% for 180 days, 1 year, and 2 years,  respectively. Additional comparisons between the abortion and birth groups were  conducted on the basis of claims for specific types of disorders and age.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare adolescent and adult reactions to abortion. A sample of 252 women from 42 states was obtained from a national  survey of organizations serving as support groups for women who have had negative  reactions to abortion. The age analysis was run using t-tests. Results indicated  that the adolescents were significantly more likely to be dissatisfied with the  choice of abortion than were the older subjects, to have abortions later in the  gestational period, to be dissatisfied with services at the time of the abortion,  to feel forced by circumstances to have the abortion, to report being misinformed  at the time of the abortion, and to report greater severity of psychological  stress. The conclusions suggest that the adolescents' problems may be due to a  combination of developmental limitations and the nature of counseling at the time  of the abortion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the psychological trauma reactions of women who had either a miscarriage or an induced abortion, in the 2 years after the event. Further, to  identify important predictors of Impact of Event Scale (IES) scores. METHOD: A  consecutive sample of women who experienced miscarriage (N = 40) or induced  abortion (N = 80) were interviewed 3 times: 10 days (T1), 6 months (T2), and 2  years (T3) after the event. RESULTS: At T1, 47.5% of the women who had a  miscarriage were cases (IES score 19 points on 1 or both of the IES subscales),  compared with 30% for women who had an induced abortion (p =.60). The  corresponding values at T3 were 2.6% and 18.1%, respectively (p =.019). At all  measurement time points, the group who had induced abortion scored higher on IES  avoidance. Women who had a miscarriage were more likely to experience feelings of  loss and grief, whereas women who had induced abortion were more likely to  experience feelings of relief, guilt, and shame. At T3, IES intrusion was  predicted by feelings of loss and grief at T1, whereas avoidance at T3 was  predicted by guilt and shame at T1. CONCLUSION: The short-term emotional  reactions to miscarriage appear to be larger and more powerful than those to  induced abortion. In the long term, however, women who had induced abortion  reported significantly more avoidance of thoughts and feelings related to the  event than women who had a miscarriage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A national study in Finland showed significantly higher death rates associated with abortion than with childbirth. Our objective was to examine this  association using an American population over a longer period. METHODS:  California Medicaid records for 173,279 women who had an induced abortion or a  delivery in 1989 were linked to death certificates for 1989 to 1997. RESULTS:  Compared with women who delivered, those who aborted had a significantly higher  age-adjusted risk of death from all causes (1.62), from suicide (2.54), and from  accidents (1.82), as well as a higher relative risk of death from natural causes  (1.44), including the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (2.18),  circulatory diseases (2.87), and cerebrovascular disease (5.46). Results are  stratified by age and time. CONCLUSIONS: Higher death rates associated with  abortion persist over time and across socioeconomic boundaries. This may be  explained by self-destructive tendencies, depression, and other unhealthy  behavior aggravated by the abortion experience.

T2  - Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research
AB  - BACKGROUND: Existing research pertaining to emotional reactions to abortion is limited by (a) short follow up periods, (b) the absence of information on prior  psychological state, and (c) lack of nationally representative samples. Therefore  the purpose of this study was to compare women with a history of abortion vs.  delivery relative to depression using a nationally representative longitudinal  design, which enabled inclusion of a control for prior psychological state.  MATERIAL/METHODS: The current study employed data for all women from the National  Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) who experienced their first pregnancy event  (abortion or childbirth) between 1980 and 1992 (n=1,884). Depression scores in  1992, an average of 8 years after the subjects' first pregnancy events, were  compared after controlling for age, race, marital status, divorce history,  education, income, and external locus of control scores. The latter was used to  control for pre-pregnancy psychological state. Results were also examined  separately for groups based on race, marital status, and divorce history.  RESULTS: After controlling for several socio-demographic factors, women whose  first pregnancies ended in abortion were 65% more likely to score in the  'high-risk' range for clinical depression than women whose first pregnancies  resulted in a birth. Differences were greatest among the demographic groups most  likely to report an abortion. CONCLUSIONS: Abortion may be a risk factor for  subsequent depression in the period of 8 years after the pregnancy event. The  higher rates of depression identified may be due to delayed reactions,  persistence of depression, or some other common risk factor.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine rates of suicide associated with pregnancy by the type of pregnancy. DESIGN: Register linkage study. Information on suicides in women of  reproductive age was linked with the Finnish birth, abortion, and hospital  discharge registers to find out how many women who committed suicide had had a  completed pregnancy during her last year of life. SETTING: Nationwide data from  Finland. SUBJECTS: Women who committed suicide in 1987-94. RESULTS: There were 73  suicides associated with pregnancy, representing 5.4% of all suicides in women in  this age group. The mean annual suicide rate was 11.3 per 100,000. The suicide  rate associated with birth was significantly lower (5.9) and the rates associated  with miscarriage (18.1) and induced abortion (34.7) were significantly higher  than in the population. The risk associated with birth was higher among teenagers  and that associated with abortion was increased in all age groups. Women who had  committed a suicide tended to come from lower social classes and were more likely  to be unmarried than other women who had had a completed pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS:  The increased risk of suicide after an induced abortion indicates either common  risk factors for both or harmful effects of induced abortion on mental health.

AB  - This study examines the risk of depression, suicidal ideation, and lower self-esteem following an abortion versus a delivery, with and without adjusting  for important correlates. Using the National Comorbidity Survey, we tested how  first pregnancy outcome (abortion vs. delivery) related to subsequent major  depression, suicidal ideation, and self-esteem. Models controlling for risk  factors, such as background and economic factors, prepregnancy violence  experience, and prepregnancy mental health, as well as a model with all risk  factors, were examined. When no risk factors were entered in the model, women who  had abortions were more likely to have subsequent depression, OR=1.53, 95% CI  [1.05-2.22], and suicidal ideation, OR=2.02, 95% CI [1.40-2.92], but they were  not more likely to have lower self-esteem, B=-.02. When all risk factors were  entered, pregnancy outcome was not significantly related to later depression,  OR=0.87, 95% CI [0.54-1.37], and suicidal ideation, OR=1.19, 95% CI [0.70-2.02].  Predictors of mental health following abortion and delivery included prepregnancy  depression, suicidal ideation, and sexual violence. Policies and practices  implemented in response to the claim that abortion hurts women are not supported  by our findings. Efforts to support women's mental health should focus on known  risk factors, such as gender-based violence and prior mental health problems,  rather than abortion history.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of clinically significant psychological distress in women and men involved in first-trimester abortions and to identify  related risk factors. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A downtown  Montreal public abortion clinic and the Montreal metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS:  We recruited 197 women and 113 men involved in first-trimester abortions and  compared them with control groups composed of 728 women and 630 men 15 to 35  years old who had taken part in a previous public health survey (EnquÃªte SantÃ©  QuÃ©bec 1987). One hundred twenty-seven women and 69 men completed the follow-up  questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Level of distress as measured by the Ilfeld  Psychological Symptom Index. RESULTS: Before the abortion, 56.9% of women and  39.6% of men were much more distressed than their respective controls. Three  weeks after the abortion, 41.7% of women and 30.9% of men were still highly  distressed. Predictors of distress for women were fear of negative effects on the  relationship, unsatisfactory relationships, relationships of less than 1 year,  ambivalence about the decision to abort, not having a previous child, and  suicidal ideation (this association was weaker than in controls). Predictors for  men were fear of negative effects on the relationship, relationships of less than  1 year, preoccupation with the abortion and anxiety about its accompanying pain,  negative perceptions of their own health, suicidal gestures in the past, and  suicidal ideation in the past year (only the association with suicidal gestures  was marginally stronger than in controls). CONCLUSION: Being involved in a  first-trimester abortion can be highly distressing for both women and men.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of the study were to assess anxiety and depression in women who had experienced either a miscarriage or an induced abortion, to compare the  women's level of distress with that of a general population sample, and to find  predictors of anxiety and depression six months and five years after the event.  METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal follow-up study. Women who experienced  miscarriage (n = 40) and induced abortion (n = 80) were interviewed ten days  (T1), six months (T2), two years (T3), and five years (T4) after the event. On  each occasion, they completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the  Life Events Scale. Paired-sample t-test, logistic regression, and multiple linear  regression statistical tests were used. RESULTS: Women with miscarriage had  significantly more anxiety and depression at T1 than the general population,  while women with induced abortion had significantly more anxiety at all time  points and more depression at T1 and T2. In both groups, important predictors of  anxiety and depression at T2 and T4 were recent life events and poor former  psychiatric health. Childbirth events between T1 and T4 had no significant  influence on the scores. For women with induced abortion, doubt about the  decision to abort was related to depression at T2 (p <0.05), while a negative  attitude towards induced abortion was associated with anxiety at T2 (p <0.05) and  T4 (p <0.05). CONCLUSION: Correlates of anxiety and depression may be used to  better identify women who are at risk of negative psychological responses  following pregnancy termination.

TI  - The relationship between abortion and depression: new evidence from the fragile families and child wellbeing study.
AU  - Rees, Daniel I.
AU  - Sabia, Joseph J.
T2  - Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a number of studies have used survey data to examine the relationship between abortion and depression, none adjusted their estimates for  pre-pregnancy depression. The purpose of this study was to test if abortion is  associated with a different risk of major depression (MD) symptomatology than  other pregnancy outcomes after adjusting for prior depression. MATERIAL/METHODS:  The current study used data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study,  a representative sample of women living in large US cities who recently gave  birth. Participants were administered the Composite International Diagnostic  Interview - Short Form (CIDI-SF) during the first and second follow-up  interviews. Changes in depressive symptoms from the first to the second follow-up  interviews were related to abortion and other pregnancy outcomes including giving  birth and miscarriage. RESULTS: Women who had an abortion between the first and  second follow-up interviews were almost twice as likely to have symptoms of MD as  women who did not become pregnant. This difference could not be explained by  factors such as race, ethnicity, age, education, household income, number of  children, or prior depressive symptomatology. In fact, after adjusting for these  factors, abortion was still associated with a more than two-fold increase in the  likelihood of having depressive symptoms at second follow-up (OR=2.15, 95% CI:  1.01 to 4.57, p=0.047). Giving birth was associated with a statistically  comparable increase in the likelihood of having the symptoms of MD. CONCLUSIONS:  The results suggest that the positive association between abortion and depressive  symptoms cannot be explained by pre-pregnancy depression. Women who have an  abortion are not at higher risk of MD than those who give birth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual and situational risk factors associated with negative postabortion psychological sequelae have been identified, but the degree of  posttraumatic stress reactions and the effects of culture are largely unknown.  MATERIAL/METHODS: Retrospective data were collected using the Institute for  Pregnancy Loss Questionnaire (IPLQ) and the Traumatic Stress Institute's (TSI)  Belief Scale administered at health care facilities to 548 women (331 Russian and  217 American) who had experienced one or more abortions, but no other pregnancy  losses. RESULTS: Overall, the findings here indicated that American women were  more negatively influenced by their abortion experiences than Russian women.  While 65% of American women and 13.1% of Russian women experienced multiple  symptoms of increased arousal, re-experiencing and avoidance associated with  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 14.3% of American and 0.9% of Russian women  met the full diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Russian women had significantly higher  scores on the TSI Belief Scale than American women, indicating more disruption of  cognitive schemas. In this sample, American women were considerably more likely  to have experienced childhood and adult traumatic experiences than Russian women.  Predictors of positive and negative outcomes associated with abortion differed  across the two cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Posttraumatic stress reactions were found  to be associated with abortion. Consistent with previous research, the data here  suggest abortion can increase stress and decrease coping abilities, particularly  for those women who have a history of adverse childhood events and prior  traumata. Study limitations preclude drawing definitive conclusions, but the  findings do suggest additional cross-cultural research is warranted.

AB  - The aim of the study was to obtain information on the long-term posttraumatic stress response and grief several years after termination of pregnancy due to  fetal malformation. We investigated 83 women who had undergone termination of  pregnancy between 1995 and 1999 and compared them with 60 women 14 days after  termination of pregnancy and 65 women after the spontaneous delivery of a  full-term healthy child. Women 2-7 years after termination of pregnancy were  expected to show a significantly lower degree of traumatic experience and grief  than women 14 days after termination of pregnancy. Contrary to the hypothesis,  however, the results showed no significant intergroup differences with respect to  the degree of traumatic experience. With the exception of one subscale (fear of  loss), this also applied to the grief reported by the women. However, both groups  differed significantly in their posttraumatic stress response from women who had  given spontaneous birth to a full-term healthy child. The results indicate that  termination of pregnancy is to be seen as an emotionally traumatic major life  event which leads to severe posttraumatic stress response and intense grief  reactions that are still detectable some years later.

AB  - The psychological consequences of induced abortion are complex and subject to both considerable controversy and methodological criticisms. While many women  report feelings of relief immediately after the procedure, others report feelings  of anxiety, which they attribute to their abortions. The purpose of the present  study was to examine risk of generalized anxiety following unintended pregnancies  ending in abortion or childbirth using a large representative sample of American  women. Among all women, those who aborted were found to have significantly higher  rates of subsequent generalized anxiety when controlling for race and age at  interview. Implications of the findings are discussed. In particular, findings  highlight the clinical relevance of exploring reproductive history in therapeutic  efforts to assist women seeking relief from anxiety.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that pregnant and recently pregnant women enjoy a "healthy pregnant women effect," we compared the all natural cause mortality  rates for women who were pregnant or within 1 year of pregnancy termination with  all other women of reproductive age. STUDY DESIGN: This is a population-based,  retrospective cohort study from Finland for a 14-year period, 1987 to 2000.  Information on all deaths of women aged 15 to 49 years in Finland (n=15,823) was  received from the Cause-of-Death Register and linked to the Medical Birth  Register (n=865,988 live births and stillbirths), the Register on Induced  Abortions (n=156,789 induced abortions), and the Hospital Discharge Register  (n=118,490 spontaneous abortions) to identify pregnancy-associated deaths  (n=419). RESULTS: The age-adjusted mortality rate for women during pregnancy and  within 1 year of pregnancy termination was 36.7 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies,  which was significantly lower than the mortality rate among nonpregnant women,  57.0 per 100,000 person-years (relative risk [RR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.58-0.71). The  mortality was lower after a birth (28.2/100,000) than after a spontaneous  (51.9/100,000) or induced abortion (83.1/100,000). We observed a significant  increase in the risk of death from cerebrovascular diseases after delivery among  women aged 15 to 24 years (RR 4.08, 95% CI 1.58-10.55). CONCLUSION: Our study  supports the healthy pregnant woman effect for all pregnancies, including those  not ending in births.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous research has revealed a general association between induced abortion and substance use. The purpose of this study was to examine the  correlation when substance use is measured specifically during a subsequent  pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A nationally representative sample of women was surveyed  about substance use during pregnancy shortly after giving birth. Women with a  previous induced abortion, whose second pregnancy was delivered, were compared  separately with women with one previous birth and with women with no previous  births. RESULTS: Compared with women who gave birth, women who had had an induced  abortion were significantly more likely to use marijuana (odds ratio, 10.29; 95%  CI, 3.47-30.56), various illicit drugs (odds ratio, 5.60; 95% CI, 2.39-13.10),  and alcohol (odds ratio, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.31-3.76) during their next pregnancy.  The results with only first-time mothers were very similar. CONCLUSION:  Psychosocial mechanisms that may explain the findings are discussed. Screening  for abortion history may help to identify pregnant women who are at risk for  substance use more effectively.

AB  - Abortion is known to be associated with higher rates of substance abuse, but no studies have compared substance use rates associated with abortion compared to  delivery of an unintended pregnancy. This study examines data for women in the  National Longitudinal Survey of Youth whose first pregnancy was unintended. Women  with no pregnancies were also used as a control group. Use of alcohol, marijuana,  cocaine, and behaviors suggestive of alcohol abuse were examined an average of  four years after the target pregnancy among women with prior histories of  delivering an unintended pregnancy (n = 535), abortion (n = 213), or those who  reported no pregnancies (n = 1144). Controls were instituted for age, race,  marital status, income, education, and prepregnancy self-esteem and locus of  control. Compared to women who carried an unintended first pregnancy to term,  those who aborted were significantly more likely to report use of marijuana (odds  ratio: 2.0), with the difference in these two groups approaching significance  relative to the use of cocaine (odds ratio: 2.49). Women with a history of  abortion also reported more frequent drinking than those with a history of  unintended birth. With the exception of less frequent drinking, the unintended  birth group was not significantly different from the no pregnancy group.  Resolution of an unintended pregnancy by abortion was associated with  significantly higher rates of subsequent substance use compared to delivering an  unintended pregnancy. A history of abortion may be a useful marker for  identifying women in need of counseling for substance use.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine associations between abortion history and a wide range of anxiety (panic disorder, panic attacks, PTSD, Agoraphobia),  mood (bipolar disorder, mania, major depression), and substance abuse disorders  (alcohol and drug abuse and dependence) using a nationally representative US  sample, the national comorbidity survey. Abortion was found to be related to an  increased risk for a variety of mental health problems (panic attacks, panic  disorder, agoraphobia, PTSD, bipolar disorder, major depression with and without  hierarchy), and substance abuse disorders after statistical controls were  instituted for a wide range of personal, situational, and demographic variables.  Calculation of population attributable risks indicated that abortion was  implicated in between 4.3% and 16.6% of the incidence of these disorders. Future  research is needed to identify mediating mechanisms linking abortion to various  disorders and to understand individual difference factors associated with  vulnerability to developing a particular mental health problem after abortion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Other than premenstrual dysphoria, few studies have examined the extent to which basic characteristics of the menstrual cycle and the occurrence  of other reproductive landmarks impact on the risk of major depression. METHODS:  From a population-based sample of 4161 premenopausal women 36-45 years of age, we  identified 332 women who met DSM criteria for past or current major depression  and a sample of 644 women with no such history. In person interviews included a  detailed assessment of menstrual cycle characteristics from age at menarche  through study enrollment as well as other reproductive landmarks. RESULTS: Risk  of depression increased significantly with decreasing age at menarche (P<0.001).  The risk of depression was also higher in women with heavier menstrual flow and  cycle irregularity during the first 5 years of menstruation. Women with a history  of multiple abortions were 2-3-times more likely to develop major depression (95%  CI 1.6-4.1). Increasing months of breastfeeding was associated with a decreased  risk of depression after adjustment for education, marital status, and number of  livebirths (P-value, test of trend=0.012). This association was largely confined  to depression during the postpartum period. LIMITATIONS: Menstrual and pregnancy  history exposures were self-reported and retrospectively assessed. However, women  with and without a HISTORY of depression were subject to similar recall  requirements that likely resulted in an underestimate of most risk estimates.  CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians involved in routine obstetrical and gynecological care of  women need to recognize that menstrual and pregnancy history events may serve as  potential markers for subsequent psychiatric sequelae.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study were to explore maternal history of perinatal loss and pregnancy wantedness as correlates of substance use during  pregnancy. METHOD: The research design involved interviewing women who gave birth  in Washington DC hospitals during 1992. Interview data included pregnancy history  (prior births, induced abortions, miscarriages, and stillbirths), desire for the  pregnancy (wanted, not wanted, mistimed), socio-demographic information, timing  of onset of prenatal care, and substance use (cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs)  during pregnancy. RESULTS: A history of induced abortion was associated with  elevated risk for maternal substance use of various forms; whereas other forms of  perinatal loss (miscarriage and stillbirth) were not related to substance use.  Unwanted pregnancy was associated with cigarette smoking during pregnancy, but  not with any other forms of substance use. CONCLUSIONS: Reproductive history  information may offer insight to professionals pertaining to the likelihood of  women using substances in a later pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Miscarriage and induced abortion are life events that can potentially cause mental distress. The objective of this study was to determine whether there  are differences in the patterns of normalization of mental health scores after  these two pregnancy termination events. METHODS: Forty women who experienced  miscarriages and 80 women who underwent abortions at the main hospital of  Buskerud County in Norway were interviewed. All subjects completed the following  questionnaires 10 days (T1), six months (T2), two years (T3) and five years (T4)  after the pregnancy termination: Impact of Event Scale (IES), Quality of Life,  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and another addressing their  feelings about the pregnancy termination. Differential changes in mean scores  were determined by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and inter-group differences  were assessed by ordinary least squares methods. RESULTS: Women who had  experienced a miscarriage had more mental distress at 10 days and six months  after the pregnancy termination than women who had undergone an abortion.  However, women who had had a miscarriage exhibited significantly quicker  improvement on IES scores for avoidance, grief, loss, guilt and anger throughout  the observation period. Women who experienced induced abortion had significantly  greater IES scores for avoidance and for the feelings of guilt, shame and relief  than the miscarriage group at two and five years after the pregnancy termination  (IES avoidance means: 3.2 vs 9.3 at T3, respectively, p < 0.001; 1.5 vs 8.3 at  T4, respectively, p < 0.001). Compared with the general population, women who had  undergone induced abortion had significantly higher HADS anxiety scores at all  four interviews (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001), while women who had had a miscarriage  had significantly higher anxiety scores only at T1 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The  course of psychological responses to miscarriage and abortion differed during the  five-year period after the event. Women who had undergone an abortion exhibited  higher scores during the follow-up period for some outcomes. The difference in  the courses of responses may partly result from the different characteristics of  the two pregnancy termination events.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study incidence and determinants of emotional distress following induced abortion. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lund  University, University Hospital MalmÃ¶, Sweden. SUBJECTS: A series of 854  participants at 12-month postabortion follow-up, representing 66.5% of the 1285  women undergoing induced abortion at MalmÃ¶, 1989. METHODS: Analysis of data  elicited at a semistructured interview 1 year after induced abortion, risk  factors for emotional distress being determined in a "case" subgroup (n = 139) of  women satisfying all the inclusion criteria (i.e., postabortion emotional  distress, doubts about abortion decision, would not consider abortion again), as  compared with a control group (n = 114) satisfying none of the inclusion  criteria. The study design is a retrospective study. RESULTS: In the subgroup  with emotional distress (duration ranging from 1 month to still present at  12-month follow-up), the following risk factors were identified: living alone,  poor emotional support from family and friends, adverse postabortion change in  relations with partner, underlying ambivalence or adverse attitude to abortion,  and being actively religious. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, 50-60% of women undergoing  induced abortion experienced some measure of emotional distress, classified as  severe in 30% of cases. The risk factors identified suggest that it may be  possible to ameliorate or even prevent such distress.

AB  - The objective of the study was to compare psychological responses of women following a pregnancy termination due to ultrasound-detected fetal anomalies  (ultrasound group) with the psychological responses of women following a late  spontaneous abortion or a perinatal death (perinatal loss group). The  assessments, which were performed on four occasions in the year after the life  event, included Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Goldberg General  Health Questionnaire, Impact of Event Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and  Schedule for Recent Life Events. In the acute phase, a few days after the life  event, the women in the ultrasound group reported statistically significantly  less depressive symptoms and less intrusion and avoidance symptoms than the  perinatal loss group. No differences in psychological responses in the two groups  were found at the examinations at approximately 7 weeks, 5 months or 1 year. A  statistically significantly higher proportion of women in the ultrasound group  reported that they had tried to become pregnant in the following year. A few  subjects in each group reported persisting high psychological distress throughout  the year, but only one woman fulfilled the criteria of a post-traumatic stress  disorder. It is concluded that the long-term psychological stress response in  women to pregnancy termination following ultrasonographic detection of fetal  anomalies does not differ from the stress responses seen in women experiencing a  perinatal loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The weight of evidence suggests that women who freely choose to terminate a pregnancy are unlikely to experience significant mental health risks,  however some studies have documented psychological distress in the form of  posttraumatic stress disorder and depression in the aftermath of termination.  Choice of anaesthetic has been suggested as a determinant of outcome. This study  compared the effects of local anaesthesia and intravenous sedation, administered  for elective surgical termination, on outcomes of pain, cortisol, and  psychological distress. METHODS: 155 women were recruited from a private abortion  clinic and state hospital (mean age: 25.4 +/- 6.1 years) and assessed on various  symptom domains, using both clinician-administered interviews and self-report  measures just prior to termination, immediately post-procedure, and at 1 month  and 3 months post-procedure. Morning salivary cortisol assays were collected  prior to anaesthesia and termination. RESULTS: The group who received local  anaesthetic demonstrated higher baseline cortisol levels (mean = 4.7 vs 0.2),  more dissociative symptoms immediately post-termination (mean = 14.7 vs 7.3), and  higher levels of pain before (mean = 4.9 vs 3.0) and during the procedure (mean =  8.0 vs 4.4). However, in the longer-term (1 and 3 months), there were no  significant differences in pain, psychological outcomes (PTSD, depression,  self-esteem, state anxiety), or disability between the groups. More than 65% of  the variance in PTSD symptoms at 3 months could be explained by baseline PTSD  symptom severity and disability, and post-termination dissociative symptoms. Of  interest was the finding that pre-procedural cortisol levels were positively  correlated with PTSD symptoms at both 1 and 3 months. CONCLUSION: High rates of  PTSD characterise women who have undergone surgical abortions (almost one fifth  of the sample meet criteria for PTSD), with women who receive local anaesthetic  experiencing more severe acute reactions. The choice of anesthetic, however, does  not appear to impact on longer-term psychiatric outcomes or functional status.

AB  - A group of 360 black teenage women of similar socioeconomic background who sought pregnancy tests from two Baltimore family planning providers was followed for two  years to determine if those who obtained abortions were adversely affected by  their abortion experience. After two years, the young women who had terminated  their pregnancies were far more likely to have graduated from high school or to  still be in school and at the appropriate grade level than were those who had  decided to carry their pregnancy to term or those whose pregnancy test had been  negative. Those who had obtained an abortion were also better off economically  than were those in the other two groups after two years. An analysis of  psychological stress showed that those who terminated their pregnancy had  experience no greater levels of stress or anxiety than had the other teenagers at  the time of the pregnancy test, and they were no more likely to have  psychological problems two years later. The teenagers who had obtained abortions  were also less likely than the other two groups to experience a subsequent  pregnancy during the following two years and were slightly more likely to  practice contraception. Thus, two years after their abortions, the young women  who had chosen to terminate an unwanted pregnancy were doing as well as (and  usually better than) those who had had a baby or who had not been pregnant.

AB  - Induced abortion is the subject of tremendous political conflict. Anti-abortion activists have frequently asserted that abortion results in major psychiatric  sequelae. The evidence, however, clearly indicates that this is not necessarily  the case. Studies performed to date confirm that it is possible to identify risk  factors, help pregnant women make decisions compatible with their own values, and  minimize psychiatric sequelae.
